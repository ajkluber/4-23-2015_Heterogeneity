abstract = {We investigate the folding mechanism of the WW domain Fip35 using a realistic atomistic force field by applying the Dominant Reaction Pathways approach. We find evidence for the existence of two folding pathways, which differ by the order of formation of the two hairpins. This result is consistent with the analysis of the experimental data on the folding kinetics of WW domains and with the results obtained from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of this system. Free-energy calculations performed in two coarse-grained models support the robustness of our results and suggest that the qualitative structure of the dominant paths are mostly shaped by the native interactions. Computing a folding trajectory in atomistic detail only required about one hour on 48 Central Processing Units. The gain in computational efficiency opens the door to a systematic investigation of the folding pathways of a large number of globular proteins.},

abstract = {To address the question of how the geometry of a protein's native conformation affects its folding and stability, we studied three model 36-mers on a cubic lattice. The native structure of one of these model 36-mers consisted mostly of local contacts, while that of a second consisted mostly of non-local contacts. The third native structure had a typical compact native conformation, and served as our reference. For each protein, the amino acid sequence was designed to have a pronounced energy minimum at its native conformation. We observed dramatic differences in folding, dependent on the presence or absence of non-local contacts. For the proteins with a typical large number of non-local contacts, the folding transition was all-or-none, whereas for the one with mostly local contacts, it was not. Although the maximum rate of folding was similar for all three proteins, we found that under conditions at which each native conformation was stable, the structure with mostly non-local contacts folded two orders of magnitude faster than the one with mostly local contacts. The statistical analysis of protein structure agrees fully with the implications of the theory. We discuss the importance of cooperativity in protein folding for its stability.},

The amino acid sequences were designed to have pronounced energy minimum target conformations of different length and shape. For short fully compact (36-mer) proteins, the all-or-none transition from the unfolded state to the native state was observed. This was not always the case for longer proteins. Among 12 designed sequences with the native structure of a fully compact 48-mer, a simple all-or-none transition was observed in only three cases. For the other nine sequences, three states of behavior-the native, denatured, and intermediate states-were found. The contiguous part of the native structure (domain) was conserved in the intermediate state, whereas the remaining part was completely unfolded and structureless.

abstract = {We show how to apply the method of temperature-accelerated molecular dynamics (TAMD) in collective variables [Maragliano L, Vanden-Eijnden E (2006) Chem Phys Lett 426:168-175] to sample the conformational space of multidomain proteins in all-atom, explicitly solvated molecular dynamics simulations. The method allows the system to hyperthermally explore the free-energy surface in a set of collective variables computed at the physical temperature. As collective variables, we pick Cartesian coordinates of centers of contiguous subdomains. The method is applied to the GroEL subunit, a 55-kDa, three-domain protein, and HIV-1 gp120. For GroEL, the method induces in about 40 ns conformational changes that recapitulate the t --> r('') transition and are not observed in unaccelerated molecular dynamics: The apical domain is displaced by 30 A, with a twist of 90 degrees relative to the equatorial domain, and the root-mean-squared deviation relative to the r('') conformer is reduced from 13 to 5 A, representing fairly high predictive capability. For gp120, the method predicts both counterrotation of inner and outer domains and disruption of the so-called bridging sheet. In particular, TAMD on gp120 initially in the CD4-bound conformation visits conformations that deviate by 3.6 A from the gp120 conformer in complex with antibody F105, again reflecting good predictive capability. TAMD generates plausible all-atom models of the so-far structurally uncharacterized unliganded conformation of HIV-1 gp120, which may prove useful in the development of inhibitors and immunogens. The fictitious temperature employed also gives a rough estimate of 10 kcal/mol for the free-energy barrier between conformers in both cases.},

abstract = {A key step in drug development is the identification of both a protein target and its topological cellular network location and interactions, with regard to information flow in disease-causing events and to medication effects. Information flow involves a cascade of binding or covalent modification processes, with each step being affected by those that occur previously. Proteins are flexible, and information flows via dynamic changes in the distribution of conformational protein ensembles; molecular recognition is mainly determined by these changes. Drug discovery often focuses on signaling proteins situated at the crossroads of cellular networks; such signaling proteins have multiple partners that bind through shared binding sites. This review highlights these shared binding sites, and describes research to suggest that partners binding at these sites could at least partly interact via different energetically dominant 'hot-spot' residues. The data also indicate that, despite dynamic changes in the distribution of the conformational ensembles, the hot-spot conformations are retained in their pre-organized states.},

The process involves the collection of sufficient and diverse high-quality data, translation of these data into spatial restraints, and an optimization that uses the restraints to generate an ensemble of structures consistent with the data. Analysis of the ensemble produces a detailed architectural map of the assembly. We developed our approach on a challenging model system, the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The NPC acts as a dynamic barrier, controlling access to and from the nucleus, and in yeast is a 50 MDa assembly of 456 proteins. The resulting structure, presented in an accompanying paper, reveals the configuration of the proteins in the NPC, providing insights into its evolution and architectural principles. The present approach should be applicable to many other macromolecular assemblies.},

In yeast, this ability allows them to act as non-Mendelian elements of phenotypic inheritance. To further our understanding of prion biology, we conducted a bioinformatic proteome-wide survey for prionogenic proteins in S. cerevisiae, followed by experimental investigations of 100 prion candidates. We found an unexpected amino acid bias in aggregation-prone candidates and discovered that 19 of these could also form prions. At least one of these prion proteins, Mot3, produces a bona fide prion in its natural context that increases population-level phenotypic heterogeneity. The self-perpetuating states of these proteins present a vast source of heritable phenotypic variation that increases the adaptability of yeast populations to diverse environments.},

Our approach was to create 2 proteins that (i) are stably folded into 2 different folds, (ii) have 2 different functions, and (iii) are very similar in sequence. In this simplified sequence space we explore the mutational path from one fold to another. We show that an IgG-binding, 4beta+alpha fold can be transformed into an albumin-binding, 3-alpha fold via a mutational pathway in which neither function nor native structure is completely lost. The stabilities of all mutants along the pathway are evaluated, key high-resolution structures are determined by NMR, and an explanation of the switching mechanism is provided. We show that the conformational switch from 4beta+alpha to 3-alpha structure can occur via a single amino acid substitution. On one side of the switch point, the 4beta+alpha fold is >90\% populated (pH 7.2, 20 degrees C). A single mutation switches the conformation to the 3-alpha fold, which is >90\% populated (pH 7.2, 20 degrees C). We further show that a bifunctional protein exists at the switch point with affinity for both IgG and albumin.},

We describe the design of these homologous heteromorphic proteins, their structural properties as determined by NMR, their conformational stabilities, and their affinities for their respective ligands: IgG and serum albumin. Each of these proteins is completely folded at 25 degrees C, is monomeric, and retains the native binding activity. The complete binding epitope for both ligands is encoded within each of the proteins. The IgG-binding epitope is functional only in the alpha/beta fold, and the albumin-binding epitope is functional only in the 3-alpha fold. These results demonstrate that two monomeric folds and two different functions can be encoded with only 12\% of the amino acids in a protein (7 of 56). The fact that 49 aa in these proteins are compatible with both folds shows that the essential information determining a fold can be highly concentrated in a few amino acids and that a very limited subset of interactions in the protein can tip the balance from one monomer fold to another. This delicate balance helps explain why protein structure prediction is so challenging. Furthermore, because a few mutations can result in both new conformation and new function, the evolution of new folds driven by natural selection for alternative functions may be much more probable than previously recognized.},

abstract = {A method for combining calculations of residue pKa's with changes in the position of polar hydrogens has been developed. The Boltzmann distributions of proton positions in hydroxyls and neutral titratable residues are found in the same Monte Carlo sampling procedure that determines the amino acid ionization states at each pH. Electrostatic, Lennard-Jones potentials, and torsion angle energies are considered at each proton position. Many acidic and basic residues are found to have significant electrostatic interactions with either a water- or hydroxyl-containing side chain. Protonation state changes are coupled to reorientation of the neighboring hydroxyl dipoles, resulting in smaller free energy differences between neutral and ionized residues than when the protein is held rigid. Multiconformation pH titration gives better agreement with the experimental pKa's for triclinic hen egg lysozyme than conventional rigid protein calculations. The hydroxyl motion significantly increases the protein dielectric response, making it sensitive to the composition of the local protein structure. More than one conformer per residue is often found at a given pH, providing information about the distribution of low-energy lysozyme structures.},

C. Allen and G. C. Rutledge, J. Chem. Phys. 128, 154115 (2008)]. In this work, we test the transferability of these potentials, derived from simulations of monomeric solute in monomeric solvent, to mixtures of solutes and to solute chains in the same monomeric solvent. For this purpose, "transferability" refers to the predictive capability of the potentials without additional optimization. We find that RDF transferability to mixtures is very good, while RDF errors in systems of chains increase linearly with chain length. Excess chemical potential transferability is good for mixtures at low solute concentration, chains, and chains of mixed composition; at higher solute concentrations in mixtures, chemical potential transferability fails due to the nature of the DDIS potentials, in which particle insertion directly affects the interaction potential. With these results, we demonstrate that DDIS potentials derived for pure solutes can be used effectively in the study of many important systems including those involving mixtures, chains, and chains of mixed composition in monomeric solvent.},

abstract = {Implicit solvent simulations are those in which solvent molecules are not explicitly simulated, and the solute-solute interaction potential is modified to compensate for the implicit solvent effect. Implicit solvation is well known in Brownian dynamics of dilute solutions but offers promise to speed up many other types of molecular simulations as well, including studies of proteins and colloids where the local density can vary considerably. This work examines implicit solvent potentials within a more general coarse-graining framework. While a pairwise potential between solute sites is relatively simple and ubiquitous, an additional parametrization based on the local solute concentration has the possibility to increase the accuracy of the simulations with only a marginal increase in computational cost. We describe here a method in which the radial distribution function and excess chemical potential of solute insertion for a system of Lennard-Jones particles are first measured in a fully explicit, all-particle simulation, and then reproduced across a range of solute particle densities in an implicit solvent simulation.},

abstract = {The free energy cost $\Delta$G of partitioning many unfolded peptides into membrane interfaces is unfavorable due to the cost of partitioning backbone peptide bonds. The partitioning cost is dramatically reduced if the peptide bonds participate in hydrogen bonds. The reduced cost underlies secondary structure formation by amphiphilic peptides partitioned into membrane interfaces through a process referred to as partitioning-folding coupling. This coupling is characterized by the free energy reduction per residue, ∆G(res) that drives folding. There is some debate about the correct value of ∆G(res) and its dependence on the hydrophobic moment ($\mu$(H)) of amphiphilic $\alpha$-helical peptides. We show how to compute ∆G(res) correctly. Using published data for two families of peptides with different hydrophobic moments and charges, we find that ∆G(res) does not depend upon $\mu$(H). The best estimate of ∆G(res) is -0.37 ± 0.02 kcal mol(-1). This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane protein structure and function.},

The experiments indicate that spectrin repeats can form stable unfolding intermediates when subjected to external forces. In the simulations the unfolding proceeded via a variety of pathways. Stable intermediates were associated to kinking of the central helix close to a proline residue. A mutant stabilizing the central helix showed no intermediates in experiments, in agreement with simulation. Spectrin repeats may thus function as elastic elements, extendable to intermediate states at various lengths.},

abstract = {The X-ray structure of the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NavAb has been reported in a conformation with a closed conduction pore. Comparison between this structure and the activated-open and resting-closed structures of the voltage-gated Kv1.2 potassium channel suggests that the voltage-sensor domains (VSDs) of the reported structure are not fully activated. Using the aforementioned structures of Kv1.2 as templates, molecular dynamics simulations are used to identify analogous functional conformations of NavAb. Specifically, starting from the NavAb crystal structure, conformations of the membrane-bound channel are sampled along likely pathways for activation of the VSD and opening of the pore domain. Gating charge computations suggest that a structural rearrangement comparable to that occurring between activated-open and resting-closed states is required to explain experimental values of the gating charge, thereby confirming that the reported VSD structure is likely an intermediate along the channel activation pathway. Our observation that the X-ray structure exhibits a low pore domain-opening propensity further supports this notion. The present molecular dynamics study also identifies conformations of NavAb that are seemingly related to the resting-closed and activated-open states. Our findings are consistent with recent structural and functional studies of the orthologous channels NavRh, NaChBac, and NavMs and offer possible structures for the functionally relevant conformations of NavAb.},

abstract = {Zinc accumulates in the synaptic vesicles of certain glutamatergic forebrain neurons and modulates neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity by multiple poorly understood mechanisms. Zinc directly inhibits NMDA-sensitive glutamate-gated channels by two separate mechanisms: high-affinity binding to N-terminal domains of GluN2A subunits reduces channel open probability, and low-affinity voltage-dependent binding to pore-lining residues blocks the channel. Insight into the high-affinity allosteric effect has been hampered by the receptor's complex gating; multiple, sometimes coupled, modulatory mechanisms; and practical difficulties in avoiding transient block by residual Mg2+. To sidestep these challenges, we examined how nanomolar zinc concentrations changed the gating kinetics of individual block-resistant receptors. We found that blockinsensitive channels had lower intrinsic open probabilities but retained high sensitivity to zinc inhibition. Binding of zinc to these receptors resulted in longer closures and shorter openings within bursts of activity but had no effect on interburst intervals. Based on kinetic modeling of these data, we conclude that zinc-bound receptors have higher energy barriers to opening and less stable open states. We tested this model for its ability to predict zinc-dependent changes in macroscopic responses and to infer the impact of nanomolar zinc concentrations on synaptic currents mediated by 2A-type NMDA receptors. © 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {NMDA receptors are heteromeric glutamate-gated channels composed of GluN1 and GluN2 subunits. Receptor isoforms that differ in their GluN2-subunit type (A-D) are expressed differentially throughout the central nervous system and have distinct kinetic properties in recombinant systems. How specific receptor isoforms contribute to the functions generally attributed to NMDA receptors remains unknown, due in part to the incomplete functional characterization of individual receptor types and unclear molecular composition of native receptors. We examined the stationary gating kinetics of individual rat recombinant GluN1/GluN2B receptors in cell-attached patches of transiently transfected HEK293 cells and used kinetic analyses and modeling to describe the full range of this receptor's gating behaviors. We found that, like GluN1/GluN2A receptors, GIuNI/ GluN2B receptors have three gating modes that are distinguishable by their mean open durations. However, for GluN1/GluN2B receptors, the modes also differed markedly in their mean closed durations and thus generated a broader range of open probabilities. We also found that regardless of gating mode, glutamate dissociation occurred -4-fold more slowly (/f= 15 s-1) compared to that observed in GluN1/GluN2A receptors. On the basis of these results, we suggest that slow glutamate dissociation and modal gating underlie the long heterogeneous activations of GluN1/GluN2B receptors. © 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Regions of amino-acid sequence that are compatible with multiple folds may facilitate evolutionary transitions in protein structure. In a previous study, we described a heuristically designed chameleon sequence (SASF1, structurally ambivalent sequence fragment 1) that could adopt either of two naturally occurring conformations ($\alpha$-helical or $\beta$-sheet) when incorporated as part of the C-terminal dimerization subdomain of two structurally divergent transcription factors, P22 Cro and $\lambda$ Cro. Here we describe longer chameleon designs (SASF2 and SASF3) that in the case of SASF3 correspond to the full C-terminal half of the ordered region of a P22 Cro/$\lambda$ Cro sequence alignment (residues 34-57). P22-SASF2 and $\lambda$(WDD)-SASF2 show moderate thermal stability in denaturation curves monitored by circular dichroism (T(m) values of 46 and 55°C, respectively), while P22-SASF3 and $\lambda$(WDD)-SASF3 have somewhat reduced stability (T(m) values of 33 and 49°C, respectively). (13)C and (1)H NMR secondary chemical shift analysis confirms two C-terminal $\alpha$-helices for P22-SASF2 (residues 36-45 and 54-57) and two C-terminal $\beta$-strands for $\lambda$(WDD)-SASF2 (residues 40-45 and 50-52), corresponding to secondary structure locations in the two parent sequences. Backbone relaxation data show that both chameleon sequences have a relatively well-ordered structure. Comparisons of (15)N-(1)H correlation spectra for SASF2 and SASF3-containing proteins strongly suggest that SASF3 retains the chameleonism of SASF2. Both Cro C-terminal conformations can be encoded in a single sequence, showing the plausibility of linking different Cro folds by smooth evolutionary transitions. The N-terminal subdomain, though largely conserved in structure, also exerts an important contextual influence on the structure of the C-terminal region.},

Nonetheless, new evidence suggests the likelihood of protein fold being neither physically nor biologically invariant. Alternative folds discovered in several proteins are composed of constant and variable parts. The latter display context-dependent conformations and a tendency to form new oligomeric interfaces. In turn, oligomerisation mediates fold evolution without loss of protein function. Gene duplication breaks down homo-oligomeric symmetry and relieves the pressure to maintain the local architecture of redundant active sites; this can lead to further structural changes. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Oftentimes these regions are introduced into the protein scaffold for function and increase frustration in the otherwise smooth-funneled landscape. Interestingly, while functional regions add complexity to folding landscapes, they may also contribute to a unique behavior referred to as hysteresis. While hysteresis is predicted to be rare, it is observed in various proteins, including proteins containing a unique peptide cyclization to form a fluorescent chromophore as well as proteins containing a knotted topology in their native fold. Here, hysteresis is demonstrated to be a consequence of the decoupling of unfolding events from the isomerization or hula-twist of a chromophore in one protein and the untying of the knot in a second protein system. The question now is- can hysteresis be a marker for the interplay of landscapes where complex folding and functional regions overlap?},

abstract = {Recent experimental studies suggest that the mature GFP has an unconventional landscape composed of an early folding event with a typical funneled landscape, followed by a very slow search and rearrangement step into the locked, active chromophore-containing structure. As we have shown previously, the substantial difference in time scales is what generates the observed hysteresis in thermodynamic folding. The interconversion between locked and the soft folding structures at intermediate denaturant concentrations is so slow that it is not observed under the typical experimental observation time. Simulations of a coarse-grained model were used to describe the fast folding event as well as identify native-like intermediates on energy landscapes enroute to the fluorescent native fold. Interestingly, these simulations reveal structural features of the slow dynamic transition to chromophore activation. Experimental evidence presented here shows that the trapped, native-like intermediate has structural heterogeneity in residues previously linked to chromophore formation. We propose that the final step of GFP folding is a "locking" mechanism leading to chromophore formation and high stability. The combination of previous experimental work and current simulation work is explained in the context of a dual-basin folding mechanism described above.},

abstract = {Nanosecond lasers were used to measure the rate of conformational changes in myoglobin after ligand dissociation at ambient temperatures. At low solvent viscosities the rate is independent of viscosity, but at high viscosities it depends on approximately the inverse first power of the viscosity. Kramers theory for unimolecular rate processes can be used to explain this result if the friction term is modified to include protein as well as solvent friction. The theory and experiment suggest that the dominant factor in markedly reducing the rate of conformational changes in myoglobin at low temperatures (less than 200 K) is the very high viscosity (greater than 10(7) centipoise) of the glycerol-water solvent. That is, at low temperatures conformational substates may not be "frozen" so much as "stuck."},

abstract = {Elucidating the mechanism of folding of polynucleotides depends on accurate estimates of free energy surfaces and a quantitative description of the kinetics of structure formation. Here, the kinetics of hairpin formation in single-stranded DNA are measured after a laser temperature jump. The kinetics are modeled as configurational diffusion on a free energy surface obtained from a statistical mechanical description of equilibrium melting profiles. The effective diffusion coefficient is found to be strongly temperature-dependent in the nucleation step as a result of formation of misfolded loops that do not lead to subsequent zipping. This simple system exhibits many of the features predicted from theoretical studies of protein folding, including a funnel-like energy surface with many folding pathways, trapping in misfolded conformations, and non-Arrhenius folding rates.},

abstract = {The canonical conformational states occupied by most ligand-gated ion channels, and many cell-surface receptors, are the resting, activated, and desensitized states. While the resting and activated states of multiple receptors are well characterized, elaboration of the structural properties of the desensitized state, a state that is by definition inactive, has proven difficult. Here we use electrical, chemical, and crystallographic experiments on the AMPA-sensitive GluR2 receptor, defining the conformational rearrangements of the agonist binding cores that occur upon desensitization of this ligand-gated ion channel. These studies demonstrate that desensitization involves the rupture of an extensive interface between domain 1 of 2-fold related glutamate-binding core subunits, compensating for the ca. 21 degrees of domain closure induced by glutamate binding. The rupture of the domain 1 interface allows the ion channel to close and thereby provides a simple explanation to the long-standing question of how agonist binding is decoupled from ion channel gating upon receptor desensitization.},

A crystal structure (2HQW; 1.96 A) of calcium-saturated CaM bound to NR1C1 (peptide spanning 875-898) showed that NR1 S890, whose phosphorylation regulates membrane localization, was solvent protected, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum retention motif was solvent exposed. NR1 F880 filled the CaM C-domain pocket, whereas T886 was closest to the N-domain pocket. This 1-7 pattern was most similar to that in the CaM-MARCKS complex. Comparison of CaM-ligand wrap-around conformations identified a core tetrad of CaM C-domain residues (FLMM(C)) that contacted all ligands consistently. An identical tetrad of N-domain residues (FLMM(N)) made variable sets of contacts with ligands. This CaM-NR1C1 structure provides a foundation for designing mutants to test the role of CaM in NR1 trafficking as well as insights into how the homologous CaM domains have different roles in molecular recognition.},

abstract = {Ligand-gated ion channels are allosteric membrane proteins that isomerize between C(losed) and O(pen) conformations. A difference in affinity for ligands in the two states influences the C↔O "gating" equilibrium constant. The energies associated with adult-type mouse neuromuscular nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) channel gating have been measured by using single-channel electrophysiology. Without ligands, the free energy, enthalpy and entropy of gating are $\Delta$G0=+8.4, $\Delta$H0=+10.9 and T$\Delta$S0=+2.5kcal/mol (-100mV, 23°C). Many mutations throughout the protein change $\Delta$G0, including natural ones that cause disease. Agonists and most mutations change approximately independently the ground-state energy difference; thus, it is possible to forecast and engineer AChR responses simply by combining perturbations. The free energy of the low↔high affinity change for the neurotransmitter at each of two functionally equivalent binding sites is $\Delta$GB(ACh)=-5.1kcal/mol. $\Delta$GB(ACh) is set mainly by interactions of ACh with just three binding site aromatic groups. For a series of structurally related agonists, there is a correlation between the energies of low- and high-affinity binding, which implies that gating commences with the formation of the low-affinity complex. Brief, intermediate states in binding and gating have been detected. Several proposals for the nature of the gating transition-state energy landscape and the isomerization mechanism are discussed.},

We investigated the gating reaction mechanism of fully liganded NR1/NR2A recombinant NMDARs (expressed in Xenopus oocytes) by fitting all possible three-closed/two-open-state, noncyclic kinetic schemes to currents elicited by saturating concentrations of glutamate plus glycine. The adequacy of each scheme was assessed by maximum likelihood values and autocorrelation coefficients of single-channel currents, as well as by the predicted time courses of transient macroscopic currents. Two schemes provided the best description for NMDAR gating at both the single-channel and macroscopic levels. These two schemes had coupled open states, only one gateway between the closed and open aggregates, and at least two preopening closed states. These two models could be condensed into a cyclic reaction mechanism. Using a linear reaction scheme, the overall "gating" rates (from the initial stable closed state to the final stable open state) are 177 and 4.4 s(-1).},

abstract = {Myoglobin rebinding of carbon monoxide and dioxygen after photodissociation has been observed in the temperature range between 40 and 350 K. A system was constructed that records the change in optical absorption at 436 nm smoothly and without break between 2 musec and 1 ksec. Four different rebinding processes have been found. Between 40 and 160 K, a single process is observed. It is not exponential in time, but approximately given by N(t) = (1 + t/to)-n, where to and n are temperature-dependent, ligand-concentration independent, parameters. At about 170 K, a second and at 200 K, a third concentration-independent process emerge. At 210 K, a concentration-dependent process sets in. If myoglobin is embedded in a solid, only the first three can be seen, and they are all nonexponential. In a liquid glycerol-water solvent, rebinding is exponential. To interpret the data, a model is proposed in which the ligand molecule, on its way from the solvent to the binding site at the ferrous heme iron, encounters four barriers in succession. The barriers are tentatively identified with known features of myoglobin. By computer-solving the differential equation for the motion of a ligand molecule over four barriers, the rates for all important steps are obtained. The temperature dependences of the rates yield enthalpy, entropy, and free-energy changes at all barriers. The free-energy barriers at 310 K indicate how myoglobin achieves specificity and order. For carbon monoxide, the heights of these barriers increase toward the inside; carbon monoxide consequently is partially rejected at each of the four barriers. Dioxygen, in contrast, sees barriers of about equal height and moves smoothly toward the binding site. The entropy increases over the first two barriers, indicating a rupturing of bonds or displacement of residues, and then smoothly decreases, reaching a minimum at the binding site. The magnitude of the decrease over the innermost barrier implies participation of heme and/or protein. The nonexponential rebinding observed at low temperatures and in solid samples implies that the innermost barrier has a spectrum of activation energies. The shape of the spectrum has been determined; its existence can be explained by assuming the presence of many conformational states for myoglobin. In a liquid at temperatures above about 230 K, relaxation among conformational states occurs and rebinding becomes exponential.},

abstract = {This paper is devoted to the development of a theoretical and computational framework denominated dominant reaction pathways (DRPs) to efficiently sample the statistically significant thermally activated reaction pathways, in multidimensional systems. The DRP approach is consistently derived from the Langevin equation through a systematic expansion in the thermal energy, k(B)T. Its main advantage with respect to existing simulation techniques is that it provides a natural and rigorous framework to perform the path sampling using constant displacement steps, rather than constant time steps. In our previous work, we have shown how to obtain the set of most probable reaction pathways, i.e., the lowest order in the k(B)T expansion. In this work, we show how to compute the corrections to the leading order due to stochastic fluctuations around the most probable trajectories. We also discuss how to obtain predictions for the evolution of arbitrary observables and how to generate conformations, which are representative of the transition state ensemble. We illustrate how our method works in practice by studying the diffusion of a point particle in a two-dimensional funneled external potential.},

We've addressed such questions using the premise that from atomic coordinates, the transfer free energy of a native protein ($\Delta$G(tr,N)) can be predicted by summing measured water-to-osmolyte transfer free energies of the protein's solvent exposed side chain and backbone component parts. $\Delta$G(tr,D) is predicted using a self avoiding random coil model for the protein, and $\Delta$G(tr,D)-$\Delta$G(tr,N), predicts the m-value, a quantity that measures the osmolyte effect on the N⇌D transition. Using literature and newly measured m-values we show 1:1 correspondence between predicted and measured m-values covering a range of 12 kcal/mol/M in protein stability for 46 proteins and 9 different osmolytes. Osmolytes present a range of side chain and backbone effects on N and D solubility and protein stability key to their biological roles.},

abstract = {In recent years, a growing number of protein folding studies have focused on the unfolded state, which is now recognized as playing a major role in the folding process. Some of these studies show that interactions occurring in the unfolded state can significantly affect the stability and kinetics of the protein folding reaction. In this study, we modeled the effect of electrostatic interactions, both native and nonnative, on the folding of three protein systems that underwent selective charge neutralization or reversal or complete charge suppression. In the case of the N-terminal L9 protein domain, our results directly attribute the increase in thermodynamic stability to destabilization of the unfolded ensemble, reaffirming the experimental observations. These results provide a deeper structural insight into the ensemble of the unfolded state and predict a new mutation site for increased protein stability. In the second case, charge reversal mutations of RNase Sa affected protein stability, with the destabilizing mutations being less destabilizing at higher salt concentrations, indicating the formation of charge-charge interactions in the unfolded state. In the N-terminal L9 and RNase Sa systems, changes in electrostatic interactions in the unfolded state that cause an increase in free energy had an overall compaction effect that suggests a decrease in entropy. In the third case, in which we compared the beta-lactalbumin and hen egg-white lysozyme protein homologues, we successfully eliminated differences between the folding kinetics of the two systems by suppressing electrostatic interactions, supporting previously reported findings. Our coarse-grained molecular dynamics study not only reproduces experimentally reported findings but also provides a detailed molecular understanding of the elusive unfolded-state ensemble and how charge-charge interactions can modulate the biophysical characteristics of folding.},

abstract = {Recent F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments show that heat-unfolded states of proteins become more compact with increasing temperature. At the same time, NMR results indicate that cold-denatured proteins are more expanded than heat-denatured proteins. To clarify the connection between these observations, we investigated the unfolded state of yeast frataxin, whose cold denaturation occurs at temperatures above 273 K, with single-molecule FRET. This method allows the unfolded state dimensions to be probed not only in the cold- and heat-denatured range but also in between, i.e., in the presence of folded protein, and can thus be used to link the two regimes directly. The results show a continuous compaction of unfolded frataxin from 274 to 320 K, with a slight re-expansion at higher temperatures. Cold- and heat-denatured states are thus essentially two sides of the same coin, and their behavior can be understood within the framework of the overall temperature dependence of the unfolded state dimensions.},

The most common strategies used to validate these models employ statistics from simulation data, such as the eigenvalue spectrum of the inferred rate matrix, which are often associated with large uncertainties. Here, we propose a Bayesian approach, which makes it possible to differentiate between models at a fixed lag time making use of short trajectories. The hierarchical definition of the models allows one to compare instances with any number of states. We apply a conjugate prior for reversible Markov chains, which was recently introduced in the statistics literature. The method is tested in two different systems, a Monte Carlo dynamics simulation of a two-dimensional model system and molecular dynamics simulations of the terminally blocked alanine dipeptide.},

abstract = {A statistical analysis of known structures is made for an assessment of the utility of short-range energy considerations. For each type of amino acid, the potentials governing (1) the torsions and bond angle changes of virtual C alpha-C alpha bonds and (2) the coupling between torsion and bond angle changes are derived. These contribute approximately -2 RT per residue to the stability of native proteins, approximately half of which is due to coupling effects. The torsional potentials for the alpha-helical states of different residues are verified to be strongly correlated with the free-energy change measurements made upon single-site mutations at solvent-exposed regions. Likewise, a satisfactory correlation is shown between the beta-sheet potentials of different amino acids and the scales from free-energy measurements, despite the role of tertiary context in stabilizing beta-sheets. Furthermore, there is excellent agreement between our residue-specific potentials for alpha-helical state and other thermodynamic based scales. Threading experiments performed by using an inverse folding protocol show that 50 of 62 test structures correctly recognize their native sequence on the basis of short-range potentials. The performance is improved to 55, upon simultaneous consideration of short-range potentials and the nonbonded interaction potentials between sequentially distant residues. Interactions between near residues along the primary structure, i.e., the local or short-range interactions, are known to be insufficient, alone, for understanding the tertiary structural preferences of proteins alone. Yet, knowledge of short-range conformational potentials permits rationalizing the secondary structure propensities and aids in the discrimination between correct and incorrect tertiary folds.},

The principal drawback of such approaches is the computational cost, which typically ranges from 3 - 10 times that of the equivalent additive model, and may be greater for more sophisticated treatments of polarization or other many-body effects. Here, we present a multiscale approach which may be used to enhance the sampling in simulations with polarizable models, by using the additive model as a tool to explore configuration space. We use a method based on information theory to determine the charges for an additive model that has optimal overlap with the polarizable one, and we demonstrate the feasibility of enhancing sampling via a hybrid replica exchange scheme for several model systems. An additional advantage is that, in the process, we obtain a systematic method for deriving charges for an additive model that will be the natural complement to its polarizable parent. The additive charges are found by an effective coarse-graining of the polarizable force field, rather than by ad hoc procedures.},

abstract = {Members of the homeodomain superfamily are three-helix bundle proteins whose second and third helices form a helix-turn-helix motif (HTH). Their folding mechanism slides from the ultrafast, three-state framework mechanism for the engrailed homeodomain (EnHD), in which the HTH motif is independently stable, to an apparent two-state nucleation-condensation model for family members with an unstable HTH motif. The folding intermediate of EnHD has nearly native HTH structure, but it is not docked with helix1. The determinant of whether two- or three-state folding was hypothesized to be the stability of the HTH substructure. Here, we describe a detailed $\Phi$-value analysis of the folding of the Pit1 homeodomain, which has similar ultrafast kinetics to that of EnHD. Formation of helix1 was strongly coupled with formation of HTH, which was initially surprising because they are uncoupled in the EnHD folding intermediate. However, we found a key difference between Pit1 and EnHD: The isolated peptide corresponding to the HTH motif in Pit1 was not folded in the absence of H1. Independent molecular dynamics simulations of Pit1 unfolding found an intermediate with H1 misfolded onto the HTH motif. The Pit1 folding pathway is the connection between that of EnHD and the slower folding homeodomains and provides a link in the transition of mechanisms from two- to three-state folding in this superfamily. The malleability of folding intermediates can lead to unstable substructures being stabilized by a variety of nonnative interactions, adding to the continuum of folding mechanisms.},

Despite considerable structural and biophysical research, the mechanism behind activation of the NMDA receptor is still poorly understood. By analyzing patch clamp recordings of one channel activated by glutamate, we determined the burst structure and open probability for recombinant rat NR1/NR2B receptors. We used partial agonists at the glutamate and glycine binding sites to show that at least two kinetically distinct subunit-associated conformational changes link co-agonist binding to the opening of the NMDA receptor pore. These data suggest that NR1 and NR2B subunits, respectively, undergo a fast and slow agonist-dependent conformational change that precedes opening of the pore. We propose a new working model of receptor activation that can account for macroscopic as well as microscopic NMDA receptor properties.},

We derive the corresponding second laws from one master fluctuation theorem and discuss their relationship. In particular, we show that both the entropy production involving mutual information between system and controller and the one involving a Shannon entropy difference of an information reservoir like a tape carry an extra term different from the usual current times affinity. We thus generalize stochastic thermodynamics to the presence of an information reservoir.},

abstract = {We show that a rate of conditional Shannon entropy reduction, characterizing the learning of an internal process about an external process, is bounded by the thermodynamic entropy production. This approach allows for the definition of an informational efficiency that can be used to study cellular information processing. We analyze three models of increasing complexity inspired by the E. coli sensory network, where the external process is an external ligand concentration jumping between two values. We start with a simple model for which ATP must be consumed so that a protein inside the cell can learn about the external concentration. With a second model for a single receptor we show that the rate at which the receptor learns about the external environment can be nonzero even without any dissipation inside the cell since chemical work done by the external process compensates for this learning rate. The third model is more complete, also containing adaptation. For this model we show inter alia that a bacterium in an environment that changes at a very slow time-scale is quite inefficient, dissipating much more than it learns. Using the concept of a coarse-grained learning rate, we show for the model with adaptation that while the activity learns about the external signal the option of changing the methylation level increases the concentration range for which the learning rate is substantial.},

abstract = {We generalize stochastic thermodynamics to include information reservoirs. Such information reservoirs, which can be modeled as a sequence of bits, modify the second law. For example, work extraction from a system in contact with a single heat bath becomes possible if the system also interacts with an information reservoir. We obtain an inequality, and the corresponding fluctuation theorem, generalizing the standard entropy production of stochastic thermodynamics. From this inequality we can derive an information processing entropy production, which gives the second law in the presence of information reservoirs. We also develop a systematic linear response theory for information processing machines. For an uni-cyclic machine powered by an information reservoir, the efficiency at maximum power can deviate from the standard value 1/2. For the case where energy is consumed to erase the tape, the efficiency at maximum erasure is found to be 1/2.},

abstract = {Curli are the major proteinaceous component of a complex extracellular matrix produced by many Enterobacteriaceae. Curli were first discovered in the late 1980s on Escherichia coli strains that caused bovine mastitis, and have since been implicated in many physiological and pathogenic processes of E. coli and Salmonella spp. Curli fibers are involved in adhesion to surfaces, cell aggregation, and biofilm formation. Curli also mediate host cell adhesion and invasion, and they are potent inducers of the host inflammatory response. The structure and biogenesis of curli are unique among bacterial fibers that have been described to date. Structurally and biochemically, curli belong to a growing class of fibers known as amyloids. Amyloid fiber formation is responsible for several human diseases including Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and prion diseases, although the process of in vivo amyloid formation is not well understood. Curli provide a unique system to study macromolecular assembly in bacteria and in vivo amyloid fiber formation. Here, we review curli biogenesis, regulation, role in biofilm formation, and role in pathogenesis.},

Factors that appear to be important for two-state folding include topology (sequence distance of contacts in the native structure), molecular cooperativity and local energy distribution. Because their local stability distributions and cooperativities can be dissected and analyzed separately from topological features, recent studies of the folding of symmetric proteins will be discussed as a means to better understand the origins of two-state folding.},

AR proteins show highly cooperative folding despite a lack of long-range contacts. Both theory and experiment converge to explain that formation of the interface between elements is more favorable than formation of any individual repeat unit. IkappaBalpha and Notch both undergo partial folding upon binding perhaps influencing the binding free energy. The simple architecture, combined with identification of consensus residues that are important for stability, has enabled systematic perturbation of the energy landscape by single point mutations that affect stability or by addition of consensus repeats. The folding energy landscapes appear highly plastic, with small perturbations re-routing folding pathways.},

abstract = {Development of a tightly packed hydrophobic core drives the folding of water-soluble globular proteins and is a key determinant of protein stability. Despite this, there remains much to be learnt about how and when the hydrophobic core becomes desolvated and tightly packed during protein folding. We have used the bacterial immunity protein Im7 to examine the specificity of hydrophobic core packing during folding. This small, four-helix protein has previously been shown to fold via a compact three-helical intermediate state. Here, overpacking substitutions, in which residue side-chain size is increased, were used to examine the specificity and malleability of core packing in the folding intermediate and rate-limiting transition state. In parallel, polar groups were introduced into the Im7 hydrophobic core via Val-->Thr or Phe-->Tyr substitutions and used to determine the solvation status of core residues at different stages of folding. Over 30 Im7 variants were created allowing both series of substitutions to cover all regions of the protein structure. Phi-value analysis demonstrated that the major changes in Im7 core solvation occur prior to the population of the folding intermediate, with key regions involved in docking of the short helix III remaining solvent-exposed until after the rate-limiting transition state has been traversed. In contrast, overpacking core residues revealed that some regions of the native Im7 core are remarkably malleable to increases in side-chain volume. Overpacking residues in other regions of the Im7 core result in substantial (>2.5 kJ mol(-1)) destabilisation of the native structure or even prevents efficient folding to the native state. This study provides new insights into Im7 folding; demonstrating that whilst desolvation occurs early during folding, adoption of a specifically packed core is achieved only at the very last step in the folding mechanism.},

Several proteins that contain the domain, such as Staphylococcal IgG binding proteins and Escherichia coli intimin, are involved in bacterial pathogenesis. LysM domains are also found in some eukaryotic proteins, apparently as a result of horizontal gene transfer from bacteria. The available evidence suggests that the LysM domain is a general peptidoglycan-binding module. We have determined the structure of this domain from E. coli membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase D. The LysM domain has a betaalphaalphabeta secondary structure with the two helices packing onto the same side of an anti- parallel beta sheet. The structure shows no similarity to other bacterial cell surface domains. A potential binding site in a shallow groove on surface of the protein has been identified.},

In this review we highlight some key experimental investigations of the folding of multidomain proteins to draw attention to the difficulties that can arise in analyzing such systems. The evidence suggests that interdomain interactions can significantly affect stability, folding, and unfolding rates. However, preliminary studies suggest that folding pathways are unaffected-to this extent domains can be truly considered to be independent folding units. Nonetheless, it is clear that interactions between domains cannot be ignored, in particular when considering the effects of mutations.},

Although early force field development was limited by the lack of direct comparisons between simulation and experiment, recent work from several labs has demonstrated direct calculation of NMR observables from protein simulations. Here we quantitatively evaluate recent molecular dynamics force fields against a suite of 524 chemical shift and J coupling ((3)JH(N)H($\alpha$), (3)JH(N)C($\beta$), (3)JH($\alpha$)C', (3)JH(N)C', and (3)JH($\alpha$)N) measurements on dipeptides, tripeptides, tetra-alanine, and ubiquitin. Of the force fields examined (ff96, ff99, ff03, ff03*, ff03w, ff99sb*, ff99sb-ildn, ff99sb-ildn-phi, ff99sb-ildn-nmr, CHARMM27, OPLS-AA), two force fields (ff99sb-ildn-phi, ff99sb-ildn-nmr) combining recent side chain and backbone torsion modifications achieve high accuracy in our benchmark. For the two optimal force fields, the calculation error is comparable to the uncertainty in the experimental comparison. This observation suggests that extracting additional force field improvements from NMR data may require increased accuracy in J coupling and chemical shift prediction. To further investigate the limitations of current force fields, we also consider conformational populations of dipeptides, which were recently estimated using vibrational spectroscopy.},

abstract = {To search for submolecular foldon units, the spontaneous reversible unfolding and refolding of staphylococcal nuclease under native conditions was studied by a kinetic native-state hydrogen exchange (HX) method. As for other proteins, it appears that staphylococcal nuclease is designed as an assembly of well-integrated foldon units that may define steps in its folding pathway and may regulate some other functional properties. The HX results identify 34 amide hydrogens that exchange with solvent hydrogens under native conditions by way of large transient unfolding reactions. The HX data for each hydrogen measure the equilibrium stability (Delta G(HX)) and the kinetic unfolding and refolding rates (k(op) and k(cl)) of the unfolding reaction that exposes it to exchange. These parameters separate the 34 identified residues into three distinct HX groupings. Two correspond to clearly defined structural units in the native protein, termed the blue and red foldons. The remaining HX grouping contains residues, not well separated by their HX parameters alone, that represent two other distinct structural units in the native protein, termed the green and yellow foldons. Among these four sets, a last unfolding foldon (blue) unfolds with a rate constant of 6 x 10(-6) s(-1) and free energy equal to the protein's global stability (10.0 kcal/mol). It represents part of the beta-barrel, including mutually H-bonding residues in the beta 4 and beta 5 strands, a part of the beta 3 strand that H-bonds to beta 5, and residues at the N-terminus of the alpha2 helix that is capped by beta 5. A second foldon (green), which unfolds and refolds more rapidly and at slightly lower free energy, includes residues that define the rest of the native alpha2 helix and its C-terminal cap. A third foldon (yellow) defines the mutually H-bonded beta1-beta2-beta 3 meander, completing the native beta-barrel, plus an adjacent part of the alpha1 helix. A final foldon (red) includes residues on remaining segments that are distant in sequence but nearly adjacent in the native protein. Although the structure of the partially unfolded forms closely mimics the native organization, four residues indicate the presence of some nonnative misfolding interactions. Because the unfolding parameters of many other residues are not determined, it seems likely that the concerted foldon units are more extensive than is shown by the 34 residues actually observed.},

@article{Bell-Upp2011,
abstract = {The general thermodynamic principles behind pH driven conformational transitions of biological macromolecules are well understood. What is less obvious is how they can be used to engineer pH switches in proteins. The acid unfolding of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) was used to illustrate different factors that can affect pH-driven conformational transitions. Acid unfolding is a structural transition driven by preferential H(+) binding to the acid unfolded state (U) over the native (N) state of a protein. It is the result of carboxylic groups that titrate with more normal pK(a) values in the U state than in the N state. Acid unfolding profiles of proteins reflect a balance between electrostatic and non-electrostatic contributions to stability. Several strategies were used in attempts to turn SNase into an acid insensitive protein: (1) enhancing global stability of the protein with mutagenesis or with osmolytes, (2) use of high salt concentrations to screen Coulomb interactions, (3) stabilizing the N state through specific anion effects, (4) removing Asp or Glu residues that titrate with depressed pK(a) values in the N state, and (5) removing basic residues that might have strong repulsive interactions in the N state at low pH. The only effective way to engineer acid resistance in SNase is not through modulation of pK(a) values of Asp/Glu but by enhancing the global stability of the protein. Modulation of pH-driven conformational transitions by selective manipulation of the electrostatic component of the switch is an extremely difficult undertaking.},

abstract = {The comparison of monomeric and dimeric diphtheria toxin (DT) reveals a mode for protein association which we call domain swapping. The structure of dimeric DT has been extensively refined against data to 2.0-A resolution and a three-residue loop has been corrected as compared with our published 2.5-A-resolution structure. The monomeric DT structure has also been determined, at 2.3-A resolution. Monomeric DT is a Y-shaped molecule with three domains: catalytic (C), transmembrane (T), and receptor binding (R). Upon freezing in phosphate buffer, DT forms a long-lived, metastable dimer. The protein chain tracing discloses that upon dimerization an unprecedented conformational rearrangement occurs: the entire R domain from each molecule of the dimer is exchanged for the R domain from the other. This involves breaking the noncovalent interactions between the R domain and the C and T domains, rotating the R domain by 180 degrees with atomic movements up to 65 A, and re-forming the same noncovalent interactions between the R domain and the C and T domains of the other chain of the dimer. This conformational transition explains the long life and metastability of the DT dimer. Several other intertwined, dimeric protein structures satisfy our definition of domain swapping and suggest that domain swapping may be the molecular mechanism for evolution of these oligomers and possibly of oligomeric proteins in general.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of the protein chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 in 8 M urea at 60 degrees C were undertaken to investigate the molecular basis of chemical denaturation. The protein unfolded rapidly under these conditions, but it retained its native structure in a control simulation in water at the same temperature. The overall process of unfolding in urea was similar to that observed in thermal denaturation simulations above the protein's T(m) of 75 degrees C. The first step in unfolding was expansion of the hydrophobic core. Then, the core was solvated by water and later by urea. The denatured structures in both urea and at high temperature contained residual native helical structure, whereas the beta-structure was completely disrupted. The average residence time for urea around hydrophilic groups was six times greater than around hydrophobic residues and in all cases greater than the corresponding water residence times. Water self-diffusion was reduced 40\% in 8 M urea. Urea altered water structure and dynamics, thereby diminishing the hydrophobic effect and encouraging solvation of hydrophobic groups. In addition, through urea's weakening of water structure, water became free to compete with intraprotein interactions. Urea also interacted directly with polar residues and the peptide backbone, thereby stabilizing nonnative conformations. These simulations suggest that urea denatures proteins via both direct and indirect mechanisms.},

abstract = {The reactive flux between folded and unfolded states of a two-state protein, whose coarse-grained dynamics is described by a master equation, is expressed in terms of the commitment or splitting probabilities of the microstates in the bottleneck region. This allows one to determine how much each transition through a dividing surface contributes to the reactive flux. By repeating the analysis for a series of dividing surfaces or, alternatively, by partitioning the reactive flux into contributions of unidirectional pathways that connect reactants and products, insight can be gained into the mechanism of protein folding. Our results for the flux in a network with complex connectivity, obtained using the discrete counterpart of Kramers' theory of activated rate processes, show that the number of reactive transitions is typically much smaller than the total number of transitions that cross a dividing surface at equilibrium.},

H92 near the peptidyl transferase center binds the 3'-CCA end of amino-acylated tRNA. The GAC binds protein factors and stimulates GTP hydrolysis driving protein synthesis. The 5S rRNA binds the central protuberance and A-site finger (ASF) involved in bridges with the 30S subunit. The simulations reveal that all three 3WJs possess significant anisotropic hinge-like flexibility between their stacked stems and dynamics within the compact regions of their adjacent stems. The A-site 3WJ dynamics may facilitate accommodation of tRNA, while the 5S 3WJ flexibility appears to be essential for coordinated movements of ASF and 5S rRNA. The GAC 3WJ may support large-scale dynamics of the L7/L12-stalk region. The simulations reveal that H42-H44 rRNA segments are not fully relaxed and in the X-ray structures they are bent towards the large subunit. The bending may be related to L10 binding and is distributed between the 3WJ and the H42-H97 contact.},

Atomistic molecular simulations with explicit solvent are the most promising method for providing this information, by accounting more directly for the physical interactions that stabilize proteins. Although simulations of folding with such force fields are extremely challenging, they have become feasible as a result of recent advances in computational power, accuracy of the energy functions or 'force fields', and methods for improving sampling of folding events. I review the recent progress in these areas, and highlight future challenges and questions that we may hope to address with these methods.

abstract = {Accurate force fields are essential for the success of molecular dynamics simulations. In apparent contrast to the conformational preferences of most force fields, recent NMR experiments suggest that short polyalanine peptides in water populate the polyproline II structure almost exclusively. To investigate this apparent contradiction, with its ramifications for the assessment of molecular force fields and the structure of unfolded proteins, we performed extensive simulations of Ala(5) in water ( approximately 5 micros total time), using twelve different force fields and three different peptide terminal groups. Using either empirical or density-functional-based Karplus relations for the J-couplings, we find that most current force fields do overpopulate the alpha-region, with quantitative results depending on the choice of Karplus relation and on the peptide termini. Even after reweighting to match experiment, we find that Ala(5) retains significant alpha- and beta-populations. In fact, several force fields match the experimental data well before reweighting and have a significant helical population.

abstract = {Conformational transitions underlie the function of many biomolecular systems. Resolving intermediate structural changes, however, is challenging for both experiments and all-atom simulations because the duration of transitions is short relative to the lifetime of the stable species. Simplified descriptions based on a single experimental structure, such as elastic network models or Gō models, are not immediately applicable. Here, we develop a general method that combines multiple coarse-grained models to capture slow conformational transitions. Individually, each model describes one of the experimental structures; together, they approximate the complete energy surface. We demonstrate the method for the helix-to-sheet transition in Arc repressor N11L. We find that the transition involves the partial unfolding of the switch region, and rapid refolding into the alternate structure. Transient local unfolding is consistent with the low hydrogen exchange protection factors of the switch region. Also in agreement with experiment, the isomerization occurs independently of the global folding/dimerization transition.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of the structurally homologous proteins TNfn3 and FNfn10 have been used to investigate the contributions to side-chain dynamics measured by NMR relaxation experiments. The results reproduce the variation in core side-chain dynamics observed by NMR and highlight the relevance of anharmonic motion and transitions between local minima for explaining NMR side-chain order parameters. A method is described for calculating converged order parameters by use of replica exchange molecular dynamics in conjunction with an implicit solvent model. These simulations allow the influence of various factors, such as the flexibility of side-chains and their free volume, on the mobility to be tested by perturbing the system. Deletion mutations are found to have the largest effect on the more densely packed FNfn10. Some counterintuitive effects are seen, such as an increase in order parameters close to deletion mutation sites, but these can be rationalized in terms of direct interactions with the modified side-chains. A statistical analysis of published order parameters supports the conclusions drawn from the simulations.},

abstract = {Formation of $\alpha$-helices is a fundamental process in protein folding and assembly. By studying helix formation in molecular simulations of a series of alanine-based peptides, we obtain the temperature-dependent $\alpha$-helix propensities of all 20 naturally occurring residues with two recent additive force fields, Amber ff03w and Amber ff99SB(∗). Encouragingly, we find that the overall helix propensity of many residues is captured well by both energy functions, with Amber ff99SB(∗) being more accurate. Nonetheless, there are some residues that deviate considerably from experiment, which can be attributed to two aspects of the energy function: i), variations of the charge model used to determine the atomic partial charges, with residues whose backbone charges differ most from alanine tending to have the largest error; ii), side-chain torsion potentials, as illustrated by the effect of modifications to the torsion angles of I, L, D, N. We find that constrained refitting of residue charges for charged residues in Amber ff99SB(∗) significantly improves their helix propensity. The resulting parameters should more faithfully reproduce helix propensities in simulations of protein folding and disordered proteins.},

abstract = {In theory and in the analysis of experiments, protein folding is often described as diffusion along a single coordinate. We explore here the application of a one-dimensional diffusion model to interpret simulations of protein folding, where the parameters of a model that "best" describes the simulation trajectories are determined using a Bayesian analysis. We discuss the requirements for such a model to be a good approximation to the global dynamics, and several methods for testing its accuracy. For example, one test considers the effect of an added bias potential on the fitted free energies and diffusion coefficients. Such a bias may also be used to extend our approach to determining parameters for the model to systems that would not normally explore the full coordinate range on accessible time scales. Alternatively, the propagators predicted from the model at different "lag" times may be compared with observations from simulation. We then present some applications of the model to protein folding, including Kramers-like turnover in folding rates of coarse-grained models, the effect of non-native interactions on folding, and the effect of the chosen coordinate on the observed position-dependence of the diffusion coefficients. Lastly, we consider how our results are useful for the interpretation of experiments, and how this type of Bayesian analysis may eventually be applied directly to analyse experimental data.},

To describe the folding of a simple model of a three-helix bundle protein, we variationally optimize the weights of a projection onto the matrix of native and nonnative amino acid contacts.

abstract = {Diffusion on a low-dimensional free-energy surface is a remarkably successful model for the folding dynamics of small single-domain proteins. Complicating the interpretation of both simulations and experiments is the expectation that the effective diffusion coefficient D will in general depend on the position along the folding coordinate, and this dependence may vary for different coordinates. Here we explore the position dependence of D, its connection to protein internal friction, and the consequences for the interpretation of single-molecule experiments. We find a large decrease in D from unfolded to folded, for reaction coordinates that directly measure fluctuations in Cartesian configuration space, including those probed in single-molecule experiments. In contrast, D is almost independent of Q, the fraction of native amino acid contacts: Near the folded state, small fluctuations in position cause large fluctuations in Q, and vice versa for the unfolded state. In general, position-dependent free energies and diffusion coefficients for any two good reaction coordinates that separate reactant, product, and transition states, are related by a simple transformation, as we demonstrate. With this transformation, we obtain reaction coordinates with position-invariant D. The corresponding free-energy surfaces allow us to justify the assumptions used in estimating the speed limit for protein folding from experimental measurements of the reconfiguration time in the unfolded state, and also reveal intermediates hidden in the original free-energy projection. Lastly, we comment on the design of future single-molecule experiments that probe the position dependence of D directly.},

We find that the collective fraction of native amino acid contacts, Q, captures remarkably well the transition states for all the proteins with a folding free energy barrier. Going beyond this global picture, we devise two different measures to quantify the importance of individual interresidue contacts in the folding mechanism: (i) the log-ratio of lifetimes of contacts during folding transition paths and in the unfolded state and (ii) a Bayesian measure of how predictive the formation of each contact is for being on a transition path. Both of these measures indicate that native, or near-native, contacts are important for determining mechanism, as might be expected. More remarkably, however, we found that for almost all the proteins, with the designed protein $\alpha$3D being a notable exception, nonnative contacts play no significant part in determining folding mechanisms.},

abstract = {A recognized shortcoming in current protein simulations is that most force fields are parametrized with relatively primitive three-site water models. Since the deficiencies of the common three-site water models in reproducing the phase diagram of water are well-known, an improved description of the solvent will be required, for example, to study proteins in molecular simulations at thermodynamic conditions other than standard temperature and pressure. Here, we combine a protein force field derived from Amber ff03 together with the highly optimized TIP4P/2005 water model, with a small backbone modification to match the population of helical states obtained with the new water model to experiment. Remarkably, we find that the resulting force field, Amber ff03w, produces a more cooperative helix-coil transition, compared with the similarly "backbone-corrected" Amber ff03* model with TIP3P water, with calculated helix propagation parameters in good agreement with the experiment. The radius of gyration for nonhelical conformations is significantly larger for Amber ff03w than for Amber ff03* and shows a collapse with increasing temperature as found in single-molecule experiments on longer proteins. The origin of the collapse appears to be a more favorable enthalpic component of the peptide-solvent interaction and is correlated with increasing turn formation, in accord with the experiment. In addition to this enhanced cooperativity, we verify that, with the new force field, replica exchange folding simulations of the GB1 hairpin and Trp cage result in folded structures, starting from completely unfolded initial conditions; simulations of folded proteins are also stable. These results together suggest that Amber ff03w (with TIP4P/2005) will be well suited for studying protein folding and properties of unfolded state and intrinsically disordered proteins over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions.},

We use extensive replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the free-energy surface as a function of temperature. Most of these force fields appear similar at a global level, giving a fraction folded at 300 K between 0.2 and 0.8 in all cases, which is a difference in stability of 2.8 kT, and are generally consistent with experimental data at this temperature. The most significant differences appear in the unfolded state, where there are different residual secondary structures which are populated, and the overall dimensions of the unfolded states, which in most of the force fields are too collapsed relative to experimental F\"{o}rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) data.},

abstract = {Folding simulations on peptides and proteins using empirical force fields have demonstrated the sensitivity of the results to details of the backbone potential. A recently revised version of the additive CHARMM protein force field, which includes optimization of the backbone CMAP potential to achieve good balance between different types of secondary structure, correcting the $\alpha$-helical bias present in the former CHARMM22/CMAP energy function, is shown to result in improved cooperativity for the helix-coil transition. This is due to retention of the empirical corrections introduced in the original CMAP to reproduce folded protein structures-corrections that capture many-body effects missing from an energy surface fitted to gas phase calculations on dipeptides. The experimental temperature dependence of helix formation in (AAQAA)(3) and parameters for helix nucleation and elongation are in much better agreement with experiment than those obtained with other recent force fields. In contrast, CMAP parameters derived by fitting to a vacuum quantum mechanical surface for the alanine dipeptide do not reproduce the enhanced cooperativity, showing that the empirical backbone corrections, and not some other feature of the force field, are responsible. We also find that the cooperativity of $\beta$-hairpin formation is much improved relative to other force fields we have studied. Comparison with (ϕ,$\psi$) distributions from the Protein Data Bank further justifies the inclusion of many-body effects in the CMAP. These results suggest that the revised energy function will be suitable for both simulations of unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins and for investigating protein-folding mechanisms.},

abstract = {Two homologous fibronectin type III (fnIII) domains, FNfn10 (the 10th fnIII domain of human fibronectin) and TNfn3 (the third fnIII domain of human tenascin), have essentially the same backbone structure, although they share only approximately 24\% sequence identity. While they share a similar folding mechanism with a common core of key residues in the folding transition state, they differ in many other physical properties. We use a chimeric protein, FNoTNc, to investigate the molecular basis for these differences. FNoTNc is a core-swapped protein, containing the "outside" (surface and loops) of FNfn10 and the hydrophobic core of TNfn3. Remarkably, FNoTNc retains the structure of the parent proteins despite the extent of redesign, allowing us to gain insight into which components of each parent protein are responsible for different aspects of its behaviour. Naively, one would expect properties that appear to depend principally on the core to be similar to TNfn3, for example, the response to mutations, folding kinetics and side-chain dynamics, while properties apparently determined by differences in the surface and loops, such as backbone dynamics, would be more like FNfn10. While this is broadly true, it is clear that there are also unexpected crosstalk effects between the core and the surface. For example, the anomalous response of FNfn10 to mutation is not solely a property of the core as we had previously suggested.},

Despite efforts to understand the basis of these diseases, the precise mechanism of cell death remains stubbornly unclear. Much of the data seem to be consistent with a model in which toxicity is an inherent property of the polyQ repeat, whereas host protein sequences surrounding the polyQ expansion modulate severity, age of onset, and cell specificity. Recently, a gene, pqn-41, encoding a glutamine-rich protein, was found to promote normally occurring non-apoptotic cell death in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we review evidence for toxic and modulatory roles for polyQ repeats and their host proteins, respectively, and suggest similarities with pqn-41 function. We explore the hypothesis that toxicity mediated by glutamine-rich motifs may be important not only in pathology, but also in normal development.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels from the Cys-loop family mediate fast chemo-electrical transduction, but the mechanisms of ion permeation and gating of these membrane proteins remain elusive. Here we present the X-ray structure at 2.9 A resolution of the bacterial Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel homologue (GLIC) at pH 4.6 in an apparently open conformation. This cationic channel is known to be permanently activated by protons. The structure is arranged as a funnel-shaped transmembrane pore widely open on the outer side and lined by hydrophobic residues. On the inner side, a 5 A constriction matches with rings of hydrophilic residues that are likely to contribute to the ionic selectivity. Structural comparison with ELIC, a bacterial homologue from Erwinia chrysanthemi solved in a presumed closed conformation, shows a wider pore where the narrow hydrophobic constriction found in ELIC is removed. Comparative analysis of GLIC and ELIC reveals, in concert, a rotation of each extracellular beta-sandwich domain as a rigid body, interface rearrangements, and a reorganization of the transmembrane domain, involving a tilt of the M2 and M3 alpha-helices away from the pore axis. These data are consistent with a model of pore opening based on both quaternary twist and tertiary deformation.},

abstract = {Ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) mediate excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the nervous system. Among them, the pentameric or 'Cys-loop' receptors (pLGICs) compose a family that until recently was found in only eukaryotes. Yet a recent genome search identified putative homologues of these proteins in several bacterial species. Here we report the cloning, expression and functional identification of one of these putative homologues from the cyanobacterium Gloeobacter violaceus. It was expressed as a homo-oligomer in HEK 293 cells and Xenopus oocytes, generating a transmembrane cationic channel that is opened by extracellular protons and shows slow kinetics of activation, no desensitization and a single channel conductance of 8 pS. Electron microscopy and cross-linking experiments of the protein fused to the maltose-binding protein and expressed in Escherichia coli are consistent with a homo-pentameric organization. Sequence comparison shows that it possesses a compact structure, with the absence of the amino-terminal helix, the canonical disulphide bridge and the large cytoplasmic domain found in eukaryotic pLGICs. Therefore it embodies a minimal structure required for signal transduction. These data establish the prokaryotic origin of the family. Because Gloeobacter violaceus carries out photosynthesis and proton transport at the cytoplasmic membrane, this new proton-gated ion channel might contribute to adaptation to pH change.},

abstract = {The structural characterization of transition states is essential for understanding the mechanism of protein folding. Analyzing the effect of mutations on protein stability and folding kinetics in phi-value analysis is commonly used to gain information about the presence of side-chain interactions in transition states. Recently, specific binding of ligands to engineered binding sites was applied to monitor the formation of local structures in transition states (psi analysis). A surprising result from psi analysis was the presence of parallel folding pathways in all reported studies and a major discrepancy between phi and psi values measured in the same protein. Here, we show that psi values cannot be analyzed in the same way as other rate-equilibrium free energy relationships due to the involvement of bimolecular reactions that may have different dissociation constants for the native, unfolded and transition state. As a consequence, psi values reflect the relative binding energy (kappa) of the transition state only for the extreme values of kappa=0 or kappa=1. In all other cases, non-linear rate-equilibrium free-energy relationships (Leffler plots) are observed. This apparently indicates the presence of parallel folding pathways even if folding occurs over a single homogeneous transition state. Consequently, the results from Leffler plots do not yield information about the structural properties of the transition state. This explains the lack of agreement between results from psi analysis and other methods used to characterize protein folding transition states. We further show that the same considerations apply for the analysis of the effect of pH on protein folding.},

abstract = {Molecular recognition is central to all biological processes. For the past 50 years, Koshland's 'induced fit' hypothesis has been the textbook explanation for molecular recognition events. However, recent experimental evidence supports an alternative mechanism. 'Conformational selection' postulates that all protein conformations pre-exist, and the ligand selects the most favored conformation. Following binding the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the conformational states. Both conformational selection and induced fit appear to play roles. Following binding by a primary conformational selection event, optimization of side chain and backbone interactions is likely to proceed by an induced fit mechanism. Conformational selection has been observed for protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and RNA-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular recognition paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, catalysis, gene regulation and protein aggregation in disease, which has the potential to significantly impact our views and strategies in drug design, biomolecular engineering and molecular evolution.},

One important group of alternative scaffolds is based on repeat proteins. Nature is widely using these proteins to modulate protein-protein interactions, and even in the adaptive immune system of jawless vertebrates; the step to their application as an alternative to antibodies seems therefore logical. In this review, progress on DARPins and other repeat protein scaffolds will be discussed. Advances in their design as well as novel applications will be highlighted.},

abstract = {Binding of one protein to another is involved in nearly all biological functions, yet the principles governing the interaction of proteins are not fully understood. To analyze the contributions of individual amino acid residues in protein-protein binding we have compiled a database of 2325 alanine mutants for which the change in free energy of binding upon mutation to alanine has been measured (available at http://motorhead. ucsf.edu/thorn/hotspot). Our analysis shows that at the level of side-chains there is little correlation between buried surface area and free energy of binding. We find that the free energy of binding is not evenly distributed across interfaces; instead, there are hot spots of binding energy made up of a small subset of residues in the dimer interface. These hot spots are enriched in tryptophan, tyrosine and arginine, and are surrounded by energetically less important residues that most likely serve to occlude bulk solvent from the hot spot. Occlusion of solvent is found to be a necessary condition for highly energetic interactions.},

This can be done by expressing calculated free energies as a sum of components that correspond to the contributions of different energy terms or different parts of the system. Since the resulting components depend on the integration path, care is required for their use. We show that a linear coupling scheme for the alchemical creation of a chemical identity corresponds to a particularly useful path because it leads to a symmetric decoupling of the free energy components. The path dependence also provides an additional degree of freedom that can be used to study different processes. This latter point is illustrated by a reinterpretation of a recent simulation on wild-type and mutant azurin by Mark and van Gunsteren.},

However, it has remained unclear how this contribution is distributed along the reaction and what influence it has on the folding dynamics. Here we use a combination of single-molecule F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer, nanosecond fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, microfluidic mixing and denaturant- and viscosity-dependent protein-folding kinetics to probe internal friction in the unfolded state and at the early and late transition states of slow- and fast-folding spectrin domains.

abstract = {Random mutations under neutral or near-neutral conditions are studied by considering plausible evolutionary trajectories on "neutral nets"-i.e., collections of sequences (genotypes) interconnected via single-point mutations encoding for the same ground-state structure (phenotype). We use simple exact lattice models for the mapping between sequence and conformational spaces. Densities of states based on model intrachain interactions are determined by exhaustive conformational enumeration. We compare results from two very different interaction schemes to ascertain robustness of the conclusions. In both models, sequences in a majority of neutral nets center around a single "prototype sequence" of maximum mutational stability, tolerating the largest number of neutral mutations. General analytical considerations show that these topologies by themselves lead to higher steady-state evolutionary populations at prototype sequences. On average, native thermodynamic stability increases toward a maximum at the prototype sequence, resulting in funnel-like arrangements of native stabilities in sequence space. These observations offer a unified perspective on sequence design, native stability, and mutational stability of proteins. These principles are generalizable from native stability to any measure of fitness provided that its variation with respect to mutations is essentially smooth.},

abstract = {Cryptic allosteric sites--transient pockets in a folded protein that are invisible to conventional experiments but can alter enzymatic activity via allosteric communication with the active site--are a promising opportunity for facilitating drug design by greatly expanding the repertoire of available drug targets. Unfortunately, identifying these sites is difficult, typically requiring resource-intensive screening of large libraries of small molecules. Here, we demonstrate that Markov state models built from extensive computer simulations (totaling hundreds of microseconds of dynamics) can identify prospective cryptic sites from the equilibrium fluctuations of three medically relevant proteins--$\beta$-lactamase, interleukin-2, and RNase H--even in the absence of any ligand. As in previous studies, our methods reveal a surprising variety of conformations--including bound-like configurations--that implies a role for conformational selection in ligand binding. Moreover, our analyses lead to a number of unique insights. First, direct comparison of simulations with and without the ligand reveals that there is still an important role for an induced fit during ligand binding to cryptic sites and suggests new conformations for docking. Second, correlations between amino acid sidechains can convey allosteric signals even in the absence of substantial backbone motions. Most importantly, our extensive sampling reveals a multitude of potential cryptic sites--consisting of transient pockets coupled to the active site--even in a single protein. Based on these observations, we propose that cryptic allosteric sites may be even more ubiquitous than previously thought and that our methods should be a valuable means of guiding the search for such sites.},

Solving the folding problem will ultimately require a combination of theory, simulation, and experiment, with theory and simulation providing an atomically detailed picture of both the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding and experimental tests grounding these models in reality. However, theory and simulation generally fall orders of magnitude short of biologically relevant time scales. Here we report significant progress toward closing this gap: an atomistic model of the folding of an 80-residue fragment of the $\lambda$ repressor protein with explicit solvent that captures dynamics on a 10 milliseconds time scale. In addition, we provide a number of predictions that warrant further experimental investigation. For example, our model’s native state is a kinetic hub, and biexponential kinetics arises from the presence of many free-energy basins separated by barriers of different heights rather than a single low barrier along one reaction coordinate (the previously proposed incipient downhill folding scenario).},

abstract = {Hydrogel materials are promising vehicles for the delivery of protein therapeutics. Proteins can impart physical interactions, both steric and electrostatic in nature, that influence their release from a given gel network. Here, model proteins of varying hydrodynamic diameter and charge are directly encapsulated and their release studied from electropositive fibrillar hydrogels prepared from the self-assembling peptide, MAX8. Hydrogelation of MAX8 can be triggered in the presence of proteins for their direct encapsulation with neither effect on protein structure nor the hydrogel's mechanical properties. Bulk release of the encapsulated proteins from the hydrogels was assessed for a month time period at 37 °C before and after syringe delivery of the loaded gels to determine the influence of the protein structure on release. Release of positively charged and neutral proteins was largely governed by the sterics imposed by the network. Conversely, negatively charged proteins interacted strongly with the positively charged fibrillar network, greatly restricting their release to <10\% of the initial protein load. Partition and retention studies indicated that electrostatic interactions dictate the amount of protein available for release. Importantly, when protein encapsulated gels were delivered via syringe, the release profiles of the macromolecules show the similar trends as those observed for non-sheared gels. This study demonstrates that proteins can be directly encapsulated in self assembled MAX8 hydrogels, which can then be syringe delivered to a site where subsequent release is controlled by protein structure.},

If the conformational state of one protein molecule in a multiprotein complex influences the probability of a particular conformation in a neighbouring protein, then changes can propagate. Given suitable parameters, linear or two-dimensional arrays of allosteric subunits will then behave similar to an Ising model, exhibiting hypersharp responses to external conditions. Predictions based on this concept find good quantitative agreement in a number of experimental systems including switching of the bacterial flagellar motor, amplification of ligand signals in the Escherichia coli chemotaxis receptors, and termination of calcium sparks in cardiac muscle.

They all share three main structural and functional motifs, namely, the spectrin repeat, EF-hands, and a CH domain-containing actin-binding domain. These proteins are variously involved in organisation of the actin cytoskeleton, membrane cytoskeleton architecture, cell adhesion, and contractile apparatus. The highly modular nature of these molecules has been a hindrance to the determination of their complete structures due to the inherent flexibility imparted on the proteins, but has also been an asset, inasmuch as the individual modules were of a size amenable to structural analysis by both crystallographic and NMR approaches. Representative structures of all the major domains shared by spectrin family proteins have now been solved at atomic resolution, including in some cases multiple domains from several family members. High-resolution structures, coupled with lower resolution methods to determine the overall molecular shape of these proteins, allow us for the first time to build complete atomic structures of the spectrin family of proteins.},

In this work, we use the alpha/beta ubiquitin fold class and design two new sequences that, when characterized through folding simulations, reproduce the differences in folding mechanism seen experimentally for proteins L and G. The primary implication of this work is that patterning of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues is the physical origin for the success of relative contact-order descriptions of folding, and that these physics-based potentials provide a predictive connection between free energy landscapes and amino acid sequence (the original protein folding problem). We present results of the sequence mapping from a 20- to the three-letter code for determining a sequence that folds into the WW domain topology to illustrate future extensions to protein design.},

abstract = {Although Charcot described amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) more than 130 years ago, the mechanism underlying the characteristic selective degeneration and death of motor neurons in this common adult motor neuron disease has remained a mystery. There is no effective remedy for this progressive, fatal disorder. Modern genetics has now identified mutations in one gene [Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1)] as a primary cause and implicated others [encoding neurofilaments, cytoplasmic dynein and its processivity factor dynactin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)] as contributors to, or causes of, motor neuron diseases. These insights have enabled development of model systems to test hypotheses of disease mechanism and potential therapies. Along with errors in the handling of synaptic glutamate and the potential excitotoxic response this provokes, these model systems highlight the involvement of nonneuronal cells in disease progression and provide new therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {An increasing number of proteins demonstrate the ability to switch between very different fold topologies, expanding their functional utility through new binding interactions. Recent examples of fold switching from naturally occurring and designed systems have a number of common features: (i) The structural transitions require states with diminished stability; (ii) Switching involves flexible regions in one conformer or the other; (iii) A new binding surface is revealed in the alternate fold that can lead to both stabilization of the alternative state and expansion of biological function. Fold switching not only provides insight into how new folds evolve, but also indicates that an amino acid sequence has more information content than previously thought. A polypeptide chain can encode a stable fold while simultaneously hiding latent propensities for alternative states with novel functions. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We construct coarse master equations for peptide folding dynamics from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. A maximum-likelihood propagator-based method allows us to extract accurate rates for the transitions between the different conformational states of the small helix-forming peptide Ala5. Assigning the conformational states by using transition paths instead of instantaneous molecular coordinates suppresses the effects of fast non-Markovian dynamics. The resulting master equations are validated by comparing their analytical correlation functions with those obtained directly from the molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the master equations properly capture the character and relaxation times of the entire spectrum of conformational relaxation processes. By using the eigenvectors of the transition rate matrix, we are able to systematically coarse-grain the system. We find that a two-state description, with a folded and an unfolded state, roughly captures the slow conformational dynamics. A four-state model, with two folded and two unfolded states, accurately recovers the three slowest relaxation process with time scales between 1.5 and 7 ns. The master equation models not only give access to the slow conformational dynamics but also shed light on the molecular mechanisms of the helix-coil transition.},

@article{Buslje2009,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Mutual information (MI) theory is often applied to predict positional correlations in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to make possible the analysis of those positions structurally or functionally important in a given fold or protein family. Accurate identification of coevolving positions in protein sequences is difficult due to the high background signal imposed by phylogeny and noise. Several methods have been proposed using MI to identify coevolving amino acids in protein families.

RESULTS: After evaluating two current methods, we demonstrate how the use of sequence-weighting techniques to reduce sequence redundancy and low-count corrections to account for small number of observations in limited size sequence families, can significantly improve the predictability of MI. The evaluation is made on large sets of both in silico-generated alignments as well as on biological sequence data. The methods included in the analysis are the APC (average product correction) and RCW (row-column weighting) methods. The best performing method was APC including sequence-weighting and low-count corrections. The use of sequence-permutations to calculate a MI rescaling is shown to significantly improve the prediction accuracy and allows for direct comparison of information values across protein families. Finally, we demonstrate how a lower bound of 400 sequences <62\% identical is needed in an MSA in order to achieve meaningful predictive performances. With our contribution, we achieve a noteworthy improvement on the current procedures to determine coevolution and residue contacts, and we believe that this will have potential impacts on the understanding of protein structure, function and folding.},

Using an AFM-related technique we measured the force required to mechanically unfold these repeats to be 25 to 35 pN. Under tension, individual spectrin repeats unfold independently and in an all-or-none process. The dependence of the unfolding forces on the pulling speed reveals that the corresponding unfolding potential is shallow with an estimated width of 1.5 nm. When the unfolded polypeptide strand is relaxed, several domains refold within less than a second. The unfolding forces of the alpha-helical spectrin domains are five to ten times lower than those found in domains with beta-fold, like immunoglobulin or fibronectin Ill domains, where the tertiary structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between adjacent strands. This shows that the forces stabilizing the coiled-coil lead to a mechanically much weaker structure than multiple hydrogen-bonded beta-sheets.},

abstract = {The energy landscape theory provides a general framework for describing protein folding reactions. Because a large number of studies, however, have focused on two-state proteins with single well-defined folding pathways and without detectable intermediates, the extent to which free energy landscapes are shaped up by the native topology at the early stages of the folding process has not been fully characterized experimentally. To this end, we have investigated the folding mechanisms of two homologous three-state proteins, PTP-BL PDZ2 and PSD-95 PDZ3, and compared the early and late transition states on their folding pathways. Through a combination of Phi value analysis and molecular dynamics simulations we obtained atomic-level structures of the transition states of these homologous three-state proteins and found that the late transition states are much more structurally similar than the early ones. Our findings thus reveal that, while the native state topology defines essentially in a unique way the late stages of folding, it leaves significant freedom to the early events, a result that reflects the funneling of the free energy landscape toward the native state.},

In order to elucidate the nature and importance of these species, we have mapped the structure of the on-pathway intermediate of the four-helix protein, Im7, together with the conformational changes it undergoes as it folds to the native state. Kinetic data for 29 Im7 point mutants show that the intermediate contains three of the four helices found in the native structure, packed around a specific hydrophobic core. However, the intermediate contains many non-native interactions; as a result, hydrophobic interactions become disrupted in the rate-limiting transition state before the final helix docks onto the developing structure. The results of this study support a hierarchical mechanism of protein folding and explain why the misfolding of Im7 occurs. The data also demonstrate that non-native interactions can play a significant role in folding, even for small proteins with simple topologies.},

abstract = {Peptide self-assembly plays a role in a number of diseases, in pharmaceutical degradation, and in emerging biomaterials. Here, we aim to develop an accurate molecular-scale picture of this process using a multiscale computational approach. Recently, Shell (Shell, M. S. J. Chem. Phys. 2008, 129, 144108-7) developed a coarse-graining methodology that is based on a thermodynamic quantity called the relative entropy, a measure of how different two molecular ensembles behave. By minimizing the relative entropy between a coarse-grained peptide system and a reference all-atom system, with respect to the coarse-grained model's force field parameters, an optimized coarse-grained model can be obtained. We have reformulated this methodology using a trajectory-reweighting and perturbation strategy that enables complex coarse-grained models with at least hundreds of parameters to be optimized efficiently. This new algorithm allows for complex peptide systems to be coarse-grained into much simpler models that nonetheless recapitulate many correct features of detailed all-atom ones. In particular, we present results for a polyalanine case study, with attention to both individual peptide folding and large-scale fibril assembly.},

abstract = {If we have a system of binary variables and we measure the pairwise correlations among these variables, then the least structured or maximum entropy model for their joint distribution is an Ising model with pairwise interactions among the spins. Here we consider inhomogeneous systems in which we constrain (for example) not the full matrix of correlations, but only the distribution from which these correlations are drawn: an inverse spin glass. We argue that such models generate a block structure in the space of couplings that is analogous to the replica symmetry breaking blocks of the direct mean-field spin glass. This allows us to generate a phase diagram in the space of (measurable) moments of the distribution of correlations, and we argue that this provides a path for identifying critical behavior. We expect that these ideas will be most useful in building models for systems that are nonequilibrium statistical mechanics problems, such as networks of real neurons.},

Occasionally, hopping was observed to stop as the molecule crossed the folding barrier directly from the intermediate, demonstrating that the intermediate is on-pathway.

We show evidence, from an examination of the distribution of pairwise distances between frames, that some features of the free-energy surface are inherently high-dimensional. This makes dimensionality reduction problematic because the data does not satisfy the assumptions made in conventional manifold learning algorithms We therefore propose that when dimensionality reduction is performed on trajectory data one should think of the resultant embedding as a quickly sketched set of directions rather than a road map. In other words, the embedding tells one about the connectivity between states but does not provide the vectors that correspond to the slow degrees of freedom. This realization informs the development of sketch-map, which endeavors to reproduce the proximity information from the high-dimensionality description in a space of lower dimensionality even when a faithful embedding is not possible.},

Here, we develop a broad theoretical framework for this methodology and numerical strategies for its use in practical coarse-graining settings. In particular, we show that the relative entropy offers tight control over the errors due to coarse-graining in arbitrary microscopic properties, and suggests a systematic approach to reducing them. We also describe fundamental connections between this optimization methodology and other coarse-graining strategies like inverse Monte Carlo, force matching, energy matching, and variational mean-field theory. We suggest several new numerical approaches to its minimization that provide new coarse-graining strategies. Finally, we demonstrate the application of these theoretical considerations and algorithms to a simple, instructive system and characterize convergence and errors within the relative entropy framework.},

Although major advances have been made in understanding pertinent molecular and cellular phenomena, the mechanistic principles that govern many aspects of an immune response are not known.

Specifically, we describe work that brings together statistical mechanics and cell biology to shed light on how key molecular/cellular components of the adaptive immune system are selected to enable pathogen-specific responses. We hope these examples encourage physical chemists to work at this crossroad of disciplines where fundamental discoveries with implications for human health might be made.},

Perturbations of many different sites in the protein can change these rate constants, with those in the extracellular domain mainly affecting channel-opening and many of those in the membrane and intracellular domains mainly affecting channel-closing. We used single-channel recordings to measure the total open time per activation (tau(b)) elicited by a low concentration of the natural transmitter, acetylcholine. tau(b) increased in constructs with mutations that increased the gating equilibrium constant by either increasing the opening or decreasing the closing rate constant. However, tau(b) did not approach the same asymptote in fast-opening and slow-closing constructs. The maximum value for the slow closers was about twice that for the fast openers. One interpretation of this difference is that there is an upper limit to the channel-opening rate constant, which we estimate to be approximately 0.86 mus(-1). One possibility is that this limit is the rate of conformational change in the absence of an overall activation barrier and thus reflects the kinetic prefactor for the acetylcholine receptor opening isomerization.},

@article{Chan1995,
abstract = {What is the basis for the two-state cooperativity of protein folding? Since the 1950s, three main models have been put forward. 1. In 'helix-coil' theory, cooperativity is due to local interactions among near neighbours in the sequence. Helix-coil cooperativity is probably not the principal basis for the folding of globular proteins because it is not two-state, the forces are weak, it does not account for sheet proteins, and there is no evidence that helix formation precedes the formation of a hydrophobic core in the following pathways. 2. In the 'sidechain packing' model, cooperativity is attributed to the jigsaw-puzzle-like complementary fits of sidechains. This too is probably not the basis of folding cooperativity because exact models and experiments on homopolymers with sidechains give no evidence that sidechain freezing is two-state, sidechain complementarities in proteins are only weak trends, and the molten globule model predicted by this model is far more native-like than experiments indicate. 3. In the 'hydrophobic core collapse' model, cooperativity is due to the assembly of non-polar residues into a good core. Exact model studies show that this model gives two-state behaviour for some sequences of hydrophobic and polar monomers. It is based on strong forces. There is considerable experimental evidence for the kinetics this model predicts: the development of hydrophobic clusters and cores is concurrent with secondary structure formation. It predicts compact denatured states with sizes and degrees of disorder that are in reasonable agreement with experiments.},

abstract = {We use two simple models and the energy landscape perspective to study protein folding kinetics. A major challenge has been to use the landscape perspective to interpret experimental data, which requires ensemble averaging over the microscopic trajectories usually observed in such models. Here, because of the simplicity of the model, this can be achieved. The kinetics of protein folding falls into two classes: multiple-exponential and two-state (single-exponential) kinetics. Experiments show that two-state relaxation times have "chevron plot" dependences on denaturant and non-Arrhenius dependences on temperature. We find that HP and HP+ models can account for these behaviors. The HP model often gives bumpy landscapes with many kinetic traps and multiple-exponential behavior, whereas the HP+ model gives more smooth funnels and two-state behavior. Multiple-exponential kinetics often involves fast collapse into kinetic traps and slower barrier climbing out of the traps. Two-state kinetics often involves entropic barriers where conformational searching limits the folding speed. Transition states and activation barriers need not define a single conformation; they can involve a broad ensemble of the conformations searched on the way to the native state. We find that unfolding is not always a direct reversal of the folding process.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained, self-contained polymer models are powerful tools in the study of protein folding. They are also essential to assess predictions from less rigorous theoretical approaches that lack an explicit-chain representation. Here we review advances in coarse-grained modeling of cooperative protein folding, noting in particular that the Levinthal paradox was raised in response to the experimental discovery of two-state-like folding in the late 1960s, rather than to the problem of conformational search per se. Comparisons between theory and experiment indicate a prominent role of desolvation barriers in cooperative folding, which likely emerges generally from a coupling between local conformational preferences and nonlocal packing interactions. Many of these principles have been elucidated by native-centric models, wherein nonnative interactions may be treated perturbatively. We discuss these developments as well as recent applications of coarse-grained chain modeling to knotted proteins and to intrinsically disordered proteins.},

abstract = {Glasses are amorphous solids whose constituent particles are caged by their neighbours and thus cannot flow. This sluggishness is often ascribed to the free energy landscape containing multiple minima (basins) separated by high barriers. Here we show, using theory and numerical simulation, that the landscape is much rougher than is classically assumed. Deep in the glass, it undergoes a 'roughness transition' to fractal basins, which brings about isostaticity and marginal stability on approaching jamming. Critical exponents for the basin width, the weak force distribution and the spatial spread of quasi-contacts near jamming can be analytically determined. Their value is found to be compatible with numerical observations. This advance incorporates the jamming transition of granular materials into the framework of glass theory. Because temperature and pressure control what features of the landscape are experienced, glass mechanics and transport are expected to reflect the features of the topology we discuss here.},

abstract = {In general, the energy landscapes of real proteins are sufficiently well designed that the depths of local energetic minima are small compared with the global bias of the native state. Because of the funneled nature of energy landscapes, models that lack energetic frustration have been able to capture the main structural features of the transition states and intermediates found in experimental studies of both small and large proteins. In this study we ask: Are the experimental differences in folding mechanisms among members of a particular structural family due to local topological constraints that deviate from the tertiary fold common to the family? The beta-trefoil structural family members IL-1beta, hisactophilin, and acidic/basic FGFs were chosen to address this question. It has been observed that the topological landscape of the beta-trefoils allows for the population of diverse, geometrically disconnected routes that provide energetically similar but structurally distinct ways for this family to fold. Small changes in topology or energetics can alter the preferred route. Taken together, these results indicate that the global fold of the beta-trefoil family determines the energy landscape but that the routes accessed on that landscape might differ as a result of functional requirements of the individual family members.},

abstract = {Ionotropic glutamate receptors constitute an important family of ligand-gated ion channels for which there is little biochemical or structural data. Here we probe the domain structure and boundaries of the ligand binding domain of the AMPA-sensitive GluR2 receptor by limited proteolysis and deletion mutagenesis. To identify the proteolytic fragments, Maldi mass spectrometry and N-terminal amino acid sequencing were employed. Trypsin digestion of HS1S2 (Chen GQ, Gouaux E. 1997. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:13431-13436) in the presence and absence of glutamate showed that the ligand stabilized the S1 and S2 fragments against complete digestion. Using limited proteolysis and multiple sequence alignments of glutamate receptors as guides, nine constructs were made, folded, and screened for ligand binding activity. From this screen, the S1S21 construct proved to be trypsin- and chymotrypsin-resistant, stable to storage at 4 degrees C, and amenable to three-dimensional crystal formation. The HS1S21 variant was readily prepared on a large scale, the His tag was easily removed by trypsin, and crystals were produced that diffracted to beyond 1.5 A resolution. These experiments, for the first time, pave the way to economical overproduction of the ligand binding domains of glutamate receptors and more accurately map the boundaries of the ligand binding domain.},

According to NC, folding (formation of secondary structures and tertiary interactions) and chain collapse occur synchronously upon formation of native-like structures involving a critical number of residues. Using simple nucleation theory together with structure-based thermodynamic data, the average size of the most probable nucleus N(R)*, for single-domain proteins, is estimated to be between 15 and 30 residues. We argue that finite-sized fluctuations in this estimate can be large so that nearly half of the residues of a 100 residue protein can be part of the folding nucleus. Inclusion of surface area changes in the folded and unfolded states are important in the determination of N(R)*.},

abstract = {To explore the role of entropy and chain connectivity in protein folding, a particularly interesting scheme, namely, the circular permutation, has been used. Recently, experimental observations showed that there are large differences in the folding mechanisms between the wild-type proteins and their circular permutants. These differences are strongly related to the change in the intrachain connectivity. Some results obtained by molecular dynamics simulations also showed a good agreement with the experimental findings. Here, we use a topology-based free-energy functional method to study the role of the chain connectivity in folding by comparing features of transition states of the wild-type proteins with those of their circular permutants. We concentrate our study on 3 small globular proteins, namely, the alpha-spectrin SH3 domain (SH3), the chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2), and the ribosomal protein S6, and obtain exciting results that are consistent with the available experimental and simulation results. A heterogeneity of the interaction energies between contacts for protein CI2 and for protein S6 is also introduced, which characterizes the strong interactions between contacts with long loops, as speculated from experiments for protein S6. The comparison between the folding nucleus of the wild-type proteins and those of their circular permutants indicates that chain connectivity affects remarkably the shapes of the energy profiles and thus the folding mechanism. Further comparisons between our theoretical calculated phi(th) values and the experimental observed phi(exp) values for the 3 proteins and their permutants show that our results are in good agreement with experimental ones and that correlations between them are high. These indicate that the free-energy functional method really provides a way to analyze the folding behavior of the circular-permuted proteins and therefore the folding mechanism of the wild-type proteins.},

abstract = {In expanded CAG repeat diseases such as Huntington's disease, proteins containing polyglutamine (poly(Gln)) sequences with repeat lengths of about 37 residues or more are associated with development of both disease symptoms and neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs). Disease physiology in animal and cellular models does not always correlate with NII formation, however, and the mechanism by which aggregate formation might lead to cytotoxicity is unknown. To help evaluate various possible mechanisms, we determined the biophysical properties of a series of simple poly(Gln) peptides. The circular dichroism spectra of poly(Gln) peptides with repeat lengths of five, 15, 28 and 44 residues are all nearly identical and are consistent with a high degree of random coil structure, suggesting that the length-dependence of disease is not related to a conformational change in the monomeric states of expanded poly(Gln) sequences. In contrast, there is a dramatic increase in both the kinetics and the thermodynamic favorability of the spontaneous formation of ordered, amyloid-like aggregates for poly(Gln) peptides with repeat lengths of greater than 37 residues. At the same time, poly(Gln) peptides with repeat lengths in the 15-20 residue range, despite their poor abilities to support spontaneous, self-nucleated aggregation, are capable of efficiently adding to an already-formed aggregate. We also find that morphologically small, finely divided aggregates are much more efficient at recruiting poly(Gln) peptides than are large aggregates, suggesting a possible explanation for why disease pathology does not always correlate with the observable NII burden. Together, these data are consistent with a model for disease pathology in which critical cellular proteins possessing poly(Gln) sequences of modest length become inactivated when they are recruited into aggregates of an expanded poly(Gln) protein.},

abstract = {Protein switches are made of highly similar sequences that fold to dramatically different structures. A structural switching system with 31 sequence variants for $\alpha$ and $\alpha$+$\beta$ folds has been illustrated experimentally by He et al., Structure, 2012, 20, 283 and is investigated computationally in the present study. Methods to assign a sequence to one of the two folds are reported and analyzed. A fast and accurate protocol to identify the correct fold of the 31 sequences is based on enriching modeled structures using short molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories and scoring these structures with coarse-grained energy functions. We examine five coarse-grained energy functions and illustrate that the Hinds-Levitt potential works the best for this task. We show that enrichment by MD significantly enhances prediction accuracy. Finally, we find that melting temperature correlates well with the energy difference between the two folds (correlation coefficient ∼-0.7). The correlation reduces dramatically (∼0.4) if the absolute energy of the correct fold is considered. Moreover, prediction of melting temperature is sensitive to the structural templates. We emphasize in our analyses the use of native structures as templates since these folds are more readily available from structural biology experiments.},

Both the wild type and M100A mutant are used in this study, with the mutant providing over 90\% conversion to the bleached state under steady-state illumination. We found perturbations in both the wild type and the mutant on illumination, consistent with a more flexible structure in the long-lived signaling (I2') state. In the case of the wild type, the conformational changes detected are mainly around the chromophore region. With the M100A mutant, differences in H/D exchange between the light and dark are more extensive as compared to wild type; not only are the chromophore surroundings affected, but significant increases in deuterium uptake in the N-terminus and central beta-sheet are observed as well. On the basis of the data obtained from this study and previous findings, a sequence of events that leads to the perturbation of PYP following chromophore photoisomerization is proposed.},

In particular, the Rouse model with internal friction (RIF) captures internal friction effects as observed in single-molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) studies of a number of proteins. Here we use RIF, and its non-free draining analog, Zimm model with internal friction, to explore the effect of internal friction on the rate with which intramolecular contacts can be formed within the unfolded chain. Unlike the reconfiguration times inferred from FCS experiments, which depend linearly on the solvent viscosity, the first passage times to form intramolecular contacts are shown to display a more complex viscosity dependence. We further describe scaling relationships obeyed by contact formation times in the limits of high and low internal friction. Our findings provide experimentally testable predictions that can serve as a framework for the analysis of future studies of contact formation in proteins.},

While the rate of such a transition is well approximated by a one-dimensional Smoluchowski model that views the end-to-end distance dynamics of a polymer chain as diffusion governed by the one-dimensional potential of mean force, the same model fails rather dramatically to describe the duration of such transitions. Instead, the latter timescale is well described by a model where the chain ends diffuse freely, uninfluenced by the average entropic force imposed by the polymer chain. The effective diffusion coefficient then depends on the length scale of the loop closure transition. Our findings suggest that simple one-dimensional models, when applied to estimate the duration of reactive events in complex molecular systems, should be used with caution.},

abstract = {A challenge in molecular biology is to distinguish the key subset of residues that allow two-component signaling (TCS) proteins to recognize their correct signaling partner such that they can transiently bind and transfer signal, i.e., phosphoryl group. Detailed knowledge of this information would allow one to search sequence space for mutations that can be used to systematically tune the signal transmission between TCS partners as well as potentially encode a TCS protein to preferentially transfer signals to a nonpartner. Motivated by the notion that this detailed information is found in sequence data, we explore the sequence coevolution between signaling partners to better understand how mutations can positively or negatively alter their ability to transfer signal. Using direct coupling analysis for determining evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interactions, we apply a metric called the direct information score to quantify mutational changes in the interaction between TCS proteins and demonstrate that it accurately correlates with experimental mutagenesis studies probing the mutational change in measured in vitro phosphotransfer. Furthermore, by subtracting from our metric an appropriate null model corresponding to generic, conserved features in TCS signaling pairs, we can isolate the determinants that give rise to interaction specificity and recognition, which are variable among different TCS partners. Our methodology forms a potential framework for the rational design of TCS systems by allowing one to quickly search sequence space for mutations or even entirely new sequences that can increase or decrease our metric, as a proxy for increasing or decreasing phosphotransfer ability between TCS proteins.},

abstract = {The problem of determining the rate of end-to-end collisions for polymer chains has attracted the attention of theorists and experimentalists for more than three decades. The typical theoretical approach to this problem has focused on the case where a collision is defined as any instantaneous fluctuation that brings the chain ends to within a specific capture distance. In this paper, we study the more experimentally relevant case, where the end-to-end collision dynamics are probed by measuring the excited state lifetime of a fluorophore (or other lumiphore) attached to one chain end and quenched by a quencher group attached to the other end. Under this regime, a "contact" is defined not by the chain ends approach to within some sharp cutoff but, instead, typically by an exponentially distance-dependent process. Previous theoretical models predict that, if quenching is sufficiently rapid, a diffusion-controlled limit is attained, where such measurements report on the probe-independent, intrinsic end-to-end collision rate. In contrast, our theoretical considerations, simulations, and an analysis of experimental measurements of loop closure rates in single-stranded DNA molecules all indicate that no such limit exists, and that the measured effective collision rate has a nontrivial, fractional power-law dependence on both the intrinsic quenching rate of the fluorophore and the solvent viscosity. We propose a simple scaling formula describing the effective loop closure rate and its dependence on the viscosity, chain length, and properties of the probes. Previous theoretical results are limiting cases of this more general formula.},

We also perform experimental measurements of the loop closure times of single-stranded oligonucleotides and show that both these and previously reported internal loop closure kinetics of unfolded proteins are well described by this theoretically predicted dependence.

To study the effects of macromolecular crowding on folding thermodynamics and kinetics, we used an off-lattice model of the all-beta-sheet WW domain in the presence of large spherical particles whose interaction with the polypeptide chain is purely repulsive. At all volume fractions, phi(c), of the crowding agents the stability of the native state is enhanced. Remarkably, the refolding rates, which are larger than the value at phi(c) = 0, increase nonmonotonically as phi(c) increases, reaching a maximum at phi(c)=phi(c)(*). At high values of phi(c), the depletion-induced intramolecular attraction produces compact structures with considerable structure in the denatured state. Changes in native state stability and folding kinetics at phi(c) can be quantitatively mapped onto confinement in a volume-fraction-dependent spherical pore with radius R(s) approximately (4pi/3phi(c))(1/3) R(c) (R(c) is the radius of the crowding particles) as long as phi(c)< or =phi(c)(*). We show that the extent of native state stabilization at finite phi(c) is comparable with that in a spherical pore. In both situations, rate enhancement is due to destabilization of the denatured states with respect to phi(c) = 0.},

abstract = {Proteins fold from a highly disordered state into a highly ordered one. Traditionally, the folding problem has been stated as one of predicting "the" tertiary structure from sequential information. However, new evidence suggests that the ensemble of unfolded forms may not be as disordered as once believed, and that the native form of many proteins may not be described by a single conformation, but rather an ensemble of its own. Quantifying the relative disorder in the folded and unfolded ensembles as an entropy difference may therefore shed light on the folding process. One issue that clouds discussions of "entropy" is that many different kinds of entropy can be defined: entropy associated with overall translational and rotational Brownian motion, configurational entropy, vibrational entropy, conformational entropy computed in internal or Cartesian coordinates (which can even be different from each other), conformational entropy computed on a lattice, each of the above with different solvation and solvent models, thermodynamic entropy measured experimentally, etc. The focus of this work is the conformational entropy of coil/loop regions in proteins. New mathematical modeling tools for the approximation of changes in conformational entropy during transition from unfolded to folded ensembles are introduced. In particular, models for computing lower and upper bounds on entropy for polymer models of polypeptide coils both with and without end constraints are presented. The methods reviewed here include kinematics (the mathematics of rigid-body motions), classical statistical mechanics, and information theory.},

abstract = {The prevalence of domain-swapping in nature is a manifestation of the principle of minimal frustration in that the interactions designed by evolution to stabilize the protein are also involved in this mode of binding. We previously demonstrated that the Symmetrized-Go potential accurately predicts the experimentally observed domain-swapped structure of Eps8 based solely on the structure of the monomer. There can be, however, multiple modes of domain-swapping, reflecting a higher level of frustration, which is a consequence of symmetry. The human prion and cyanovirin-N are too frustrated to form unique domain-swapped structures on the basis of the Symmetrized-Go potential. However, supplementing the completely symmetric model with intermolecular and intramolecular disulfide bonds in the prion and cyanovirin-N proteins, respectively, yielded unique domain-swapped structures with a remarkable similarity to the experimentally observed ones. These results suggest that the disulfide bonds may sometimes be critical in overcoming the intrinsic frustration of the symmetrized energy landscapes for domain-swapping. We also discuss the implications of intermolecular disulfide bonds in the formation of mammalian prion aggregates.},

abstract = {Minding your p's and q's has become as important to protein-folding theorists as it is for those being instructed in the rules of etiquette. To assess the quality of structural reaction coordinates in predicting the transition-state ensemble (TSE) of protein folding, we benchmarked the accuracy of four structural reaction coordinates against the kinetic measure P(fold), whose value of 0.50 defines the stochastic separatrix for a two-state folding mechanism. For two proteins that fold by a simple two-state mechanism, c-src SH3 and CI-2, the Phi-values of the TSEs predicted by native topology-based reaction coordinates (including Q, the fraction of native contacts) are almost identical to those of the TSE based on P(fold), with correlation coefficients of >0.90. For proteins with complex folding mechanisms that have especially broad, asymmetrical free energy barriers such as the designed 3-ankyrin repeating protein (3ANK) or proteins with distinct intermediates such as cyanovirin-N (CV-N), we show that the ensemble of structures with P(fold) = 0.50 generally does not include the chemically relevant transition states. This weakness of P(fold) limits its usefulness in protein folding studies. For such systems, elucidating the essential features of folding mechanisms requires using multiple reaction coordinates, although the number is still rather small. At the same time, for simple folding mechanisms, there is no indication of superiority for P(fold) over structurally chosen and thermodynamically relevant reaction coordinates that correctly measure the degree of nativeness.},

abstract = {It has recently become practical to construct Markov state models (MSMs) that reproduce the long-time statistical conformational dynamics of biomolecules using data from molecular dynamics simulations. MSMs can predict both stationary and kinetic quantities on long timescales (e.g. milliseconds) using a set of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that are individually much shorter, thus addressing the well-known sampling problem in molecular dynamics simulation. In addition to providing predictive quantitative models, MSMs greatly facilitate both the extraction of insight into biomolecular mechanism (such as folding and functional dynamics) and quantitative comparison with single-molecule and ensemble kinetics experiments. A variety of methodological advances and software packages now bring the construction of these models closer to routine practice. Here, we review recent progress in this field, considering theoretical and methodological advances, new software tools, and recent applications of these approaches in several domains of biochemistry and biophysics, commenting on remaining challenges.},

abstract = {Dynamical averages based on functionals of dynamical trajectories, such as time-correlation functions, play an important role in determining kinetic or transport properties of matter. At temperatures of interest, the expectations of these quantities are often dominated by contributions from rare events, making the precise calculation of these quantities by molecular dynamics simulation difficult. Here, we present a reweighting method for combining simulations from multiple temperatures (or from simulated or parallel tempering simulations) to compute an optimal estimate of the dynamical properties at the temperature of interest without the need to invoke an approximate kinetic model (such as the Arrhenius law). Continuous and differentiable estimates of these expectations at any temperature in the sampled range can also be computed, along with an assessment of the associated statistical uncertainty. For rare events, aggregating data from multiple temperatures can produce an estimate with the desired precision at greatly reduced computational cost compared with simulations conducted at a single temperature. Here, we describe use of the method for the canonical (NVT) ensemble using four common models of dynamics (canonical distribution of Hamiltonian trajectories, Andersen thermostatting, Langevin, and overdamped Langevin or Brownian dynamics), but it can be applied to any thermodynamic ensemble provided the ratio of path probabilities at different temperatures can be computed. To illustrate the method, we compute a time-correlation function for solvated terminally-blocked alanine peptide across a range of temperatures using trajectories harvested using a modified parallel tempering protocol.},

abstract = {The plakin protein family serves to connect cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion molecules to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. Desmoplakin (DP) is an integral part of desmosomes, where it links desmosomal cadherins to the intermediate filaments. The 1056-amino-acid N-terminal region of DP contains a plakin domain common to members of the plakin family. Plakin domains contain multiple copies of spectrin repeats (SRs). We determined the crystal structure of a fragment of DP, residues 175-630, consisting of four SRs and an inserted SH3 domain. The four repeats form an elongated, rigid structure. The SH3 domain is present in a loop between two helices of an SR and interacts extensively with the preceding SR in a manner that appears to limit inter-repeat flexibility. The intimate intramolecular association of the SH3 domain with the preceding SR is also observed in plectin, another plakin protein, but not in ??-spectrin, suggesting that the SH3 domain of plakins contributes to the stability and rigidity of this subfamily of SR-containing proteins. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Kramers developed the theory on how chemical reaction rates are influenced by the viscosity of the medium. At the viscosity of water, the kinetics of unimolecular reactions are described by diffusion of a Brownian particle over a free-energy barrier separating reactants and products. For reactions in solution this famous theory extended Eyring's transition state theory, and is widely applied in physics, chemistry and biology, including to reactions as complex as protein folding. Because the diffusion coefficient of Kramers' theory is determined by the dynamics in the sparsely populated region of the barrier top, its properties have not been directly measured for any molecular system. Here we show that the Kramers diffusion coefficient and free-energy barrier can be characterized by measuring the temperature- and viscosity-dependence of the transition path time for protein folding. The transition path is the small fraction of an equilibrium trajectory for a single molecule when the free-energy barrier separating two states is actually crossed. Its duration, the transition path time, can now be determined from photon trajectories for single protein molecules undergoing folding/unfolding transitions. Our finding of a long transition path time with an unusually small solvent viscosity dependence suggests that internal friction as well as solvent friction determine the Kramers diffusion coefficient for $\alpha$-helical proteins, as opposed to a breakdown of his theory, which occurs for many small-molecule reactions. It is noteworthy that the new and fundamental information concerning Kramers' theory and the dynamics of barrier crossings obtained here come from experiments on a protein rather than a much simpler chemical or physical system.},

abstract = {F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency distributions in single-molecule experiments contain both structural and dynamical information. Extraction of this information from these distributions requires a careful analysis of contributions from dye photophysics. To investigate how mechanisms other than FRET affect the distributions obtained by counting donor and acceptor photons, we have measured single-molecule fluorescence trajectories of a small alpha/beta protein, i.e., protein GB1, undergoing two-state, folding/unfolding transitions. Alexa 488 donor and Alexa 594 acceptor dyes were attached to cysteines at positions 10 and 57 to yield two isomers-donor(10)/acceptor(57) and donor(57)/acceptor(10)-which could not be separated in the purification. The protein was immobilized via binding of a histidine tag added to a linker sequence at the N-terminus to cupric ions embedded in a polyethylene-glycol-coated glass surface. The distribution of FRET efficiencies assembled from the trajectories is complex with widths for the individual peaks in large excess of that caused by shot noise. Most of this complexity can be explained by two interfering photophysical effects-a photoinduced red shift of the donor dye and differences in the quantum yield of the acceptor dye for the two isomers resulting from differences in quenching rate by the cupric ion. Measurements of steady-state polarization, calculation of the donor-acceptor cross-correlation function from photon trajectories, and comparison of the single molecule and ensemble kinetics all indicate that conformational distributions and dynamics do not contribute to the complexity.},

We consider three variants of the Go models with different contact potentials and demonstrate scaling described by power laws and no correlation with the relative contact order parameter. We demonstrate existence of at least three kinetic universality classes that are correlated with the types of structure: the alpha-, alpha-beta-, and beta- proteins have the scaling exponents of approximately 1.7, 2.5, and 3.2, respectively. The three classes merge into one when the contact range is truncated at a reasonable value. We elucidate the role of the potential associated with the chirality of a protein.},

abstract = {The effect of temperature on mechanical unfolding of proteins is studied using a Go-like model with a realistic contact map and Lennard-Jones contact interactions. The behavior of the I27 domain of titin and its serial repeats is contrasted to that of simple secondary structures. In all cases, thermal fluctuations accelerate the unraveling process, decreasing the unfolding force nearly linearly at low temperatures. However, differences in bonding geometry lead to different sensitivity to temperature and different changes in the unfolding pattern. Due to its special native-state geometry, titin is much more thermally and elastically stable than the secondary structures. At low temperatures, serial repeats of titin show a parallel unfolding of all domains to an intermediate state, followed by serial unfolding of the domains. At high temperatures, all domains unfold simultaneously, and the unfolding distance decreases monotonically with the contact order, that is, the sequence distance between the amino acids that form the native contact.},

abstract = {Structural polyamorphism has been promoted as a means for understanding the anomalous thermodynamics and dynamics of water in the experimentally inaccessible supercooled region. In the metastable liquid region, theory has hypothesized the existence of a liquid-liquid critical point from which a dividing line separates two water species of high and low density. A recent small-angle X-ray scattering study has claimed that the two structural species postulated in the supercooled state are seen to exist in bulk water at ambient conditions. We analyze new small-angle X-ray scattering data on ambient liquid water taken at third generation synchrotron sources, and large 32,000 water molecule simulations using the TIP4P-Ew model of water, to show that the small-angle region measures standard number density fluctuations consistent with water's isothermal compressibility temperature trends. Our study shows that there is no support or need for heterogeneities in water structure at room temperature to explain the small-angle scattering data, as it is consistent with a unimodal density of the tetrahedral liquid at ambient conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Are folding pathways conserved in protein families? To test this explicitly and ask to what extent structure specifies folding pathways requires comparison of proteins with a common fold. Our strategy is to choose members of a highly diverse protein family with no conservation of function and little or no sequence identity, but with structures that are essentially the same. The immunoglobulin-like fold is one of the most common structural families, and is subdivided into superfamilies with no detectable evolutionary or functional relationship.

RESULTS: We compared the folding of a number of immunoglobulin-like proteins that have a common structural core and found a strong correlation between folding rate and stability. The results suggest that the folding pathways of these immunoglobulin-like proteins share common features.

CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to compare the folding of structurally related proteins that are members of different superfamilies. The most likely explanation for the results is that interactions that are important in defining the structure of immunoglobulin-like proteins are also used to guide folding.},

The folding mechanism of the permuted proteins emerging from our simulations is in very good agreement with the experimental observations. The differences between the folding mechanisms of the permuted and wild-type proteins seem then to be strongly related to the change in the native state topology.},

abstract = {Recent experimental results suggest that the native fold, or topology, plays a primary role in determining the structure of the transition state ensemble, at least for small, fast-folding proteins. To investigate the extent of the topological control of the folding process, we studied the folding of simplified models of five small globular proteins constructed using a Go-like potential to retain the information about the native structures but drastically reduce the energetic frustration and energetic heterogeneity among residue-residue native interactions. By comparing the structure of the transition state ensemble (experimentally determined by Phi-values) and of the intermediates with those obtained using our models, we show that these energetically unfrustrated models can reproduce the global experimentally known features of the transition state ensembles and "en-route" intermediates, at least for the analyzed proteins. This result clearly indicates that, as long as the protein sequence is sufficiently minimally frustrated, topology plays a central role in determining the folding mechanism.},

First we used a Lennard-Jones potential to design off-lattice, protein-like heteropolymer sequences, whose lowest energy (native) conformations were then identified by molecular dynamics. Then we turned to investigate whether one can find a pairwise contact potential, whose ground states are the contact maps associated with these native conformations. We show that such a requirement cannot be satisfied exactly, i.e., no such contact parameters exist. Nevertheless, we found that one can find contact energy parameters for which an energy minimization procedure, acting in the space of contact maps, yields maps whose corresponding structures are close to the native ones. Finally, we show that when these structures are used as the initial point of a molecular dynamics energy minimization process, the correct native folds are recovered with high probability.},

While a decade ago minimalist toy models were mainly designed to test general hypotheses on the principles regulating protein folding, the latest coarse-grained models are increasingly realistic and can be used to characterize quantitatively the detailed folding mechanism of specific proteins. The ability of such models to reproduce the essential features of folding dynamics suggests that each single atomic degree of freedom is not by itself particularly relevant to folding and supports a statistical mechanical approach to characterize folding transitions. When combined with more refined models and with experimental studies, the systematic investigation of protein systems and complexes using coarse-grained models can advance our theoretical understanding of the actual organizing principles that emerge from the complex network of interactions among protein atomic constituents.},

To mimic nonpolar amino acids, we utilized the model compound, N-acetyl-tryptophanamide (NATA). We find that all nonpolar amino acids behave like NATA, with a scale factor proportional to surface area. Our model with three thermodynamic parameters fully captures the nonlinear dependencies on both temperature and GdmCl concentration: binding the first guanidinium ion to NATA has favorable entropy and unfavorable enthalpy of desolvation ($\Delta$S = + 11.7 cal/mol, $\Delta$H = + 3.9 kcal/mol), while cooperativity of binding a second guanidinium has a small contribution (K = 0.032 ± 0.003). This model may be useful for better understanding of protein denaturation by temperature and GdmCl.},

abstract = {Directed evolution and protein engineering approaches used to generate novel or enhanced biomolecular function often use the evolutionary sequence diversity of protein homologs to rationally guide library design. To fully capture this sequence diversity, however, libraries containing millions of variants are often necessary. Screening libraries of this size is often undesirable due to inaccuracies of high-throughput assays, costs, and time constraints. The ability to effectively cull sequence diversity while still generating the functional diversity within a library thus holds considerable value. This is particularly relevant when high-throughput assays are not amenable to select/screen for certain biomolecular properties. Here, we summarize our recent attempts to develop an evolution-guided approach, Reconstructing Evolutionary Adaptive Paths (REAP), for directed evolution and protein engineering that exploits phylogenetic and sequence analyses to identify amino acid substitutions that are likely to alter or enhance function of a protein. To demonstrate the utility of this technique, we highlight our previous work with DNA polymerases in which a REAP-designed small library was used to identify a DNA polymerase capable of accepting non-standard nucleosides. We anticipate that the REAP approach will be used in the future to facilitate the engineering of biopolymers with expanded functions and will thus have a significant impact on the developing field of 'evolutionary synthetic biology'.},

abstract = {Atomic force microscopes and optical tweezers are widely used to probe the mechanical properties of individual molecules and molecular interactions, by exerting mechanical forces that induce transitions such as unfolding or dissociation. These transitions often occur under nonequilibrium conditions and are associated with hysteresis effects-features usually taken to preclude the extraction of equilibrium information from the experimental data. But fluctuation theorems allow us to relate the work along nonequilibrium trajectories to thermodynamic free-energy differences. They have been shown to be applicable to single-molecule force measurements and have already provided information on the folding free energy of a RNA hairpin. Here we show that the Crooks fluctuation theorem can be used to determine folding free energies for folding and unfolding processes occurring in weak as well as strong nonequilibrium regimes, thereby providing a test of its validity under such conditions. We use optical tweezers to measure repeatedly the mechanical work associated with the unfolding and refolding of a small RNA hairpin and an RNA three-helix junction. The resultant work distributions are then analysed according to the theorem and allow us to determine the difference in folding free energy between an RNA molecule and a mutant differing only by one base pair, and the thermodynamic stabilizing effect of magnesium ions on the RNA structure.},

abstract = {The characterization at atomic resolution of amyloid-like protein aggregates is one of the fundamental problems of modern biology. In particular, the question whether native-like domains are retained or completely refolded in the amyloid state and the identification of possible mechanisms for macromolecular ordered aggregation represent major unresolved puzzles. To address these issues, in this article we examine the stability, dynamics, and conservation of native-like properties of several models of a previously designed amyloid-like fibril of RNase A (Sambashivan et al., Nature 2005; 437:266–269). Through the use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we have provided molecular-level insights into the role of different parts of the sequence on the stability of fibrils, the collective properties of supramolecular complexes, and the presence of native-like conformations and dynamics in supramolecular aggregates. We have been able to show that within the fibrils the three-dimensional globular domain-swapped units preserve the conformational, dynamical, and hydration properties typical of the monomeric state, providing a rationalization for the experimentally observed catalytic activity of fibrils. The nativeness of the globular domains is not affected by the amyloidogenic stretches, which determine the molecular recognition process underlying aggregation through the formation of a stable steric zipper motif. Moreover, through the study of the hydration features of a single sheet model, we have been able to show that polyglutamine stretches of the domain-swapped ribonuclease tend to minimize the interaction with water in favor of sidechain–sidechain interactions, shedding light on the factors leading to the supramolecular assembly of $\beta$-sheet layers into dry steric zippers.

By analyzing microseconds-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a polypeptide, we find that a distance based on backbone dihedral angles performs very well in distinguishing structures that are kinetically correlated from those that are not, while the widely used C($\alpha$) root mean square distance performs more poorly. The root mean square difference between contact matrices turns out instead to be the metric providing the highest clustering coefficient, namely, according to this similarity measure, the neighbors of a structure are also, on average, neighbors among themselves. We also propose a combined distance measure which, for the system considered here, performs well both for distinguishing structures which are distant in time and for giving a consistent cluster analysis.},

abstract = {To identify the contacts that stabilise the rate-limiting transition state for folding of FNfn10 (the tenth fnIII domain of human fibronectin), 42 mutants have been analysed at 29 positions across this domain. An anomalous response to mutation means that structure formation in the A, B and G strands cannot be evaluated by this method. In all the residues analysed, phi-values are fractional and no completely structured region is observed. The analysis reveals that hydrophobic residues from the central strands of the beta-sandwich form a large core of interactions in the transition state. Br\o nsted analysis shows that the stabilisation energy from the amino acid side-chains in the transition state is approximately 40 \% of that in the native state. The protein folds by a nucleation-condensation mechanism, and tertiary interactions within the core make up the folding nucleus. Local interactions, in turns and loops, are apparently much less significant. Comparison with an homologous domain from human tenascin (TNfn3), shows that FNfn10 has a more extended, structured transition state spanning three different "layers" of the beta-sandwich. The results support the hypothesis that interactions in the common structural core guide the folding of these domains.},

abstract = {Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is a cytokine and a member of the beta-trefoil superfamily of protein structures. An interesting feature in the folding of IL-1 beta, shared with some other members of the same topological family, is the existence of a slow step in folding to the native conformation from a discrete intermediate. Wanting to probe the nature of this slow step in the folding of WT IL-1 beta (tau(1)=45 seconds), we made ten sequence variants of IL-1 beta (L10A, T9Q, T9G, C8S, C8A, N7G, N7D, L6A, R4P, and R4Q), where all mutations are located along strand 1. This strand is not protected from hydrogen exchange until late in folding. Most of the mutations showed little effect on the kinetics of folding for IL-1 beta. However, C8 is clearly involved in both the late and the early steps in folding, while sequence variants at L10 and L6 affect only late events in folding. The value of the slowest relaxation time, tau(1), which is associated with the rate of native protein formation, increased for the refolding of C8S, while C8A, L6A, and L10A showed smaller but systematic increases in the value of tau(1.)For both C8S and C8A, the value of the step associated with formation of the intermediate, tau(2), was independent of denaturant concentration. In addition, mutations in the hydrophobic core (L10A, C8A, C8S, and L6A) and, surprisingly, along the surface (T9G, T9Q, and N7G) alter the stability. The most destabilizing mutations show changes in equilibrium unfolding cooperativity, which is atypical for destabilizing mutations in IL-1 beta. Crystallographic studies indicate that mutations along strand 1 may alter the number of ordered water molecules within the core. Thus, side-chain replacement in this region can disrupt essential main-chain interactions mediated by ordered water contacts in a highly cooperative network of hydrogen bonding.},

abstract = {A modeling analysis has been conducted to assess the determinants of binding strength and specificity for three crystal complexes; the anti-hen egg white lysozyme antibody D1.3 complexed with hen egg white lysozyme (HEL), the D1.3 antibody complexed with the anti-lysozyme antibody E5.2, and barnase complexed with barstar. The strengths of individual binding components within these interfaces are evaluated using a model of binding free energy that is based on pairwise surface preferences. In all cases the energetics of binding are dominated by a relatively small number of interfacial residues that define the binding epitope. A precise geometric arrangement of these residues was not found; they were either localized to one region, or distributed throughout the binding interface. Surprisingly, interfacial crystal water molecules were calculated to contribute around 25\% of the total calculated binding strength. Theoretical alanine mutations were completed by atomic deletions of the wild-type complexes. Strong correlations were observed between the calculated changes in binding free energy (deltadeltaG(calculated)) and the experimental values (deltadeltaG(observed)) for all but three of the 30 single residue mutations in the D1.3-HEL, D1.3-E5.2 and barnase-barstar systems and for all of the double mutations in the barnase-barstar system. This analysis finds that the observed differences in binding strength are consistent with a model that accounts for the changes in binding energy from the direct contacts between each member of the complex and indirect changes due to released crystallographic water molecules that are near the mutation site. The observed energy changes for double mutations in the barnase-barstar system is fully accounted for by considering water molecules bound jointly by each member of the complex.},

abstract = {Simulations based on perfectly funneled energy landscapes often capture many of the kinetic features of protein folding. We examined whether simulations based on funneled energy functions can also describe fluctuations in native-state protein ensembles. We quantitatively compared the site-specific local stability determined from structure-based folding simulations, with hydrogen exchange protection factors measured experimentally for ubiquitin, chymotrypsin inhibitor 2, and staphylococcal nuclease. Different structural definitions for the open and closed states based on the number of native contacts for each residue, as well as the hydrogen-bonding state, or a combination of both criteria were evaluated. The predicted exchange patterns agree with the experiments under native conditions, indicating that protein topology indeed has a dominant effect on the exchange kinetics. Insights into the simplest mechanistic interpretation of the amide exchange process were thus obtained.},

abstract = {Given an all non-hydrogen-atom potential function that implicitly includes solvation effects, it is possible to adjust its parameters to favor the correct native structure for several proteins over decoys produced by ungapped threading. It is also possible to further train it to reproduce the experimental free energy of unfolding in aqueous solution at 298 K for wild-type barnase and 66 mutants. For this, the native state is represented by the crystal structure at a single energy level with a calculated low degeneracy; the denatured state is represented by the extended conformation and a high calculated degeneracy. The same two-state model can be extended to account for the stability of all 67 sequences toward urea denaturation at 298 K by building in a solvation term that depends on urea concentration. With the addition of one more parameter set to give the correct heat capacity of unfolded barnase in solution, it is possible to approximate the experimental thermodynamics of barnase thermal denaturation: melting temperature, width of thermal transition, deltaG, deltaH, deltaS, and deltaCp. This requires a novel sort of statistical mechanical model where the two states each have a Gaussian density of microscopic state distribution as a function of energy.},

abstract = {Three different lipid systems have been developed to investigate the effect of physicochemical forces within the lipid bilayer on the folding of the integral membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin. Each system consists of lipid vesicles containing two lipid species, one with phosphatidylcholine and the other with phosphatidylethanolamine headgroups, but the same hydrocarbon chains: either L-alpha-1, 2-dioleoyl, L-alpha-1,2-dipalmitoleoyl, or L-alpha-1,2-dimyristoyl. Increasing the mole fraction of the phosphatidylethanolamine lipid increases the desire of each monolayer leaflet in the bilayer to curve toward water. This increases the torque tension of such monolayers, when they are constrained to remain flat in the vesicle bilayer. Consequently, the lateral pressure in the hydrocarbon chain region increases, and we have used excimer fluorescence from pyrene-labeled phosphatidylcholine lipids to probe these pressure changes. We show that bacteriorhodopsin regenerates to about 95\% yield in vesicles of 100\% phosphatidylcholine. The regeneration yield decreases as the mole fraction of the corresponding phosphatidylethanolamine component is increased. The decrease in yield correlates with the increase in lateral pressure which the lipid chains exert on the refolding protein. We suggest that the increase in lipid chain pressure either hinders insertion of the denatured state of bacterioopsin into the bilayer or slows a folding step within the bilayer, to the extent that an intermediate involved in bacteriorhodopsin regeneration is effectively trapped.},

The enhanced stability is observed upon modifications of a loop region in the enzyme acylphosphatase and is achieved despite significant enthalpy losses. The modifications that lead to increased stability, as well as those that result in destabilization, however, strongly compromise enzymatic activity, rationalizing the preservation of the native loop structure even though it does not provide the protein with maximal stability or kinetic foldability.},

abstract = {N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are obligate heterotetrameric ligand-gated ion channels that play critical roles in learning and memory. Here, using targeted molecular dynamics simulations, we developed an atomistic model for the gating of the GluN1/GluN2A NMDA receptor. Upon agonist binding, lobe closure of the ligand-binding domain produced outward pulling of the M3-D2 linkers, leading to outward movements of the C-termini of the pore-lining M3 helices and opening of the channel. The GluN2A subunits, similar to the distal (B/D) subunits in the homotetrameric GluA2 $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionate receptor, had greater M3 outward movements and thus contributed more to channel gating than the GluN1 subunits. Our gating model is validated by functional studies, including cysteine modification data indicating wider accessibility to the GluN1 M3 helices than to the GluN2A M3 helices from the lumen of the open channel, and reveals why the Lurcher mutation in GluN1 has a stronger ability in maintaining channel opening than the counterpart in GluN2A. The resulting structural model for the open state provides an explanation for the Ca(2+) permeability of NMDA receptors, and the structural differences between the closed and open states form the basis for drug design.},

abstract = {Understanding the conformational transitions that trigger the aggregation and amyloidogenesis of otherwise soluble peptides at atomic resolution is of fundamental relevance for the design of effective therapeutic agents against amyloid-related disorders. In the present study the transition from ideal alpha-helical to beta-hairpin conformations is revealed by long timescale molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water solvent, for two well-known amyloidogenic peptides: the H1 peptide from prion protein and the Abeta(12-28) fragment from the Abeta(1-42) peptide responsible for Alzheimer's disease. The simulations highlight the unfolding of alpha-helices, followed by the formation of bent conformations and a final convergence to ordered in register beta-hairpin conformations. The beta-hairpins observed, despite different sequences, exhibit a common dynamic behavior and the presence of a peculiar pattern of the hydrophobic side-chains, in particular in the region of the turns. These observations hint at a possible common aggregation mechanism for the onset of different amyloid diseases and a common mechanism in the transition to the beta-hairpin structures. Furthermore the simulations presented herein evidence the stabilization of the alpha-helical conformations induced by the presence of an organic fluorinated cosolvent. The results of MD simulation in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE)/water mixture provide further evidence that the peptide coating effect of TFE molecules is responsible for the stabilization of the soluble helical conformation.},

abstract = {Numerous membrane proteins form multisubunit protein complexes, which contain both integral and peripheral subunits, in addition to prosthetic groups. Bacterial membrane proteins are inserted into the inner membrane by the Sec translocase and YidC insertase. Their folding can be facilitated by YidC and the phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Glycine zippers and other motifs promote transmembrane-transmembrane (TM-TM) helix interactions that may lead to the formation of $\alpha$-helical bundles of membrane proteins. During or after membrane insertion, the subunits of oligomeric membrane proteins must find each other to build the homo-oligomeric and the hetero-oligomeric membrane complexes. Although chaperones may function as assembly factors in the formation of the oligomer, many protein oligomers appear to fold and oligomerize spontaneously. Current studies show that most subunits of hetero-oligomers follow a sequential and ordered pathway to form the membrane protein complex. If the inserted protein is misfolded or the membrane protein is misassembled, quality control mechanisms exist that can degrade the proteins.},

abstract = {There is an unanswered question from previous studies of 1H/2H-exchange of amide protons of barnase. Under certain conditions, there is a relatively abrupt change from EX2 towards EX1 kinetics as the temperature is slightly increased. The change in kinetics for different mutants is not directly related to their changes in stability. We have measured the stability of the folding intermediate of barnase (I) in 2H2O under a variety of conditions and calculated its population at different temperatures. The change in kinetics correlates with the change in the population of the folding intermediate. At higher temperatures and pH, the free energy of I becomes higher than that of the denatured state, D, and the kinetics becomes EX1. The data fit a simple kinetic scheme. Such changes in kinetics may be used to detect the presence of intermediates in the folding reaction at equilibrium in native conditions, but cannot distinguish whether they are on or off-pathway.},

abstract = {It is difficult to determine whether transient folding intermediates have a cooperative (or first-order) folding transition without measuring their rates of formation directly. An intermediate I could be formed by a second-order transition from a denatured state D that is progressively changed into I as conditions are changed. We have not been able to monitor the rate of formation of the folding intermediate of barnase directly, but have analysed its reactivity and the equilibrium constant for its formation over a combination of wide ranges of temperature, concentration of denaturant and structural variation. Phase diagrams have been constructed for wild-type and 16 mutant proteins to map out the nature of the energy landscape of the denatured state. The free energy of unfolding of I, delta GD-I, changes with [urea] according to a highly cooperative transition. Further, mD-I (= delta delta GD-I/delta [urea]) for wild-type and several mutants is relatively insensitive to temperature, as would be expected for an intermediate that is formed cooperatively, rather than one that melts out according to a second-order transition. The phi-values for the formation of I change abruptly through the folding transitions rather than have the smooth changes expected for a second-order transition. There is a subset of mutants for which both mD-I and phi-value analysis indicate that a second intermediate becomes populated close to the melting temperatures of the native proteins. The folding intermediate of barnase is, thus, a relatively discrete and compact entity which is formed cooperatively.},

abstract = {In free energy calculations based on thermodynamic integration, it is necessary to compute the derivatives of the free energy as a function of one (scalar case) or several (vector case) order parameters. We derive in a compact way a general formulation for evaluating these derivatives as the average of a mean force acting on the order parameters, which involves first derivatives with respect to both Cartesian coordinates and time. This is in contrast with the previously derived formulas, which require first and second derivatives of the order parameter with respect to Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in a concrete example, the main advantage of this new formulation is the simplicity of its use, especially for complicated order parameters. It is also straightforward to implement in a molecular dynamics code, as can be seen from the pseudocode given at the end. We further discuss how the approach based on time derivatives can be combined with the adaptive biasing force method, an enhanced sampling technique that rapidly yields uniform sampling of the order parameters, and by doing so greatly improves the efficiency of free energy calculations. Using the backbone dihedral angles Phi and Psi in N-acetylalanyl-N'-methylamide as a numerical example, we present a technique to reconstruct the free energy from its derivatives, a calculation that presents some difficulties in the vector case because of the statistical errors affecting the derivatives.},

abstract = {Cold and pressure denaturation are believed to have their molecular origin in hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar groups and water. However, the direct characterization of the temperature- and pressure-dependent variations of those interactions with atomistic simulations remains challenging. We investigated the role of solvent in the cold and pressure denaturation of a model hydrophobic 32-mer polymer by performing extensive coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations including explicit solvation. Our simulations showed that the water-excluded folded state of this polymer is marginally stable and can be unfolded by heating or cooling, as well as by applying pressure, similar to globular proteins. We further detected essential population of a hairpin-like configuration prior to the collapse, which is consistently accompanied by a vapor bubble at the elbow of the kink. Increasing pressure suppresses formation of this vapor bubble by reducing water fluctuations in the hydration shell of the polymer, thus promoting unfolding. Further analysis revealed a slight reduction of water tetrahedrality in the polymer hydration shell compared to the bulk. Cold denaturation is driven by an enhanced tetrahedral ordering of hydration shell water than bulk water. At elevated pressures, the strikingly reduced fluctuations combined with the increase in interstitial water molecules in the polymer hydration shell contribute to weakening of hydrophobic interactions, thereby promoting pressure unfolding. These findings provide critical molecular insights into the changes in hydrophobic hydration during cold and pressure unfolding of a hydrophobic polymer, which is strongly related to the cold and pressure denaturation of globular proteins.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained models have been extremely valuable in promoting our understanding of protein folding. However, the quantitative accuracy of existing simplified models is strongly hindered either from the complete removal of frustration (as in the widely used Gō-like models) or from the compromise with the minimal frustration principle and/or realistic protein geometry (as in the simple on-lattice models). We present a coarse-grained model that "naturally" incorporates sequence details and energetic frustration into an overall minimally frustrated folding landscape. The model is coupled with an optimization procedure to design the parameters of the protein Hamiltonian to fold into a desired native structure. The application to the study of src-Src homology 3 domain shows that this coarse-grained model contains the main physical-chemical ingredients that are responsible for shaping the folding landscape of this protein. The results illustrate the importance of nonnative interactions and energetic heterogeneity for a quantitative characterization of folding mechanisms.},

Next, we combine simulation and experimental results (see companion article in this issue) to achieve a comprehensive assessment of the folding landscape of this protein. Remarkably, simulated kinetic and equilibrium analyses show an excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental folding data of this study. The results of this comparison show that a simplified, completely unfrustrated C(alpha) model correctly reproduces the complex folding features of a large multidomain protein with complex topology. The success of this effort underlines the importance of synergistic experimental/theoretical approaches to achieve a broader understanding of the folding landscape.},

Using a systematic proteomics approach, we identified several hundred proteins that become more insoluble with age in the multicellular organism Caenorhabditis elegans. These proteins are predicted to be significantly enriched in beta-sheets, which promote disease protein aggregation. Strikingly, these insoluble proteins are highly over-represented in aggregates found in human neurodegeneration. We examined several of these proteins in vivo and confirmed their propensity to aggregate with age. Different proteins aggregated in different tissues and cellular compartments. Protein insolubility and aggregation were significantly delayed or even halted by reduced insulin/IGF-1-signaling, which also slows aging. We found a significant overlap between proteins that become insoluble and proteins that influence lifespan and/or polyglutamine-repeat aggregation. Moreover, overexpressing one aggregating protein enhanced polyglutamine-repeat pathology. Together our findings indicate that widespread protein insolubility and aggregation is an inherent part of aging and that it may influence both lifespan and neurodegenerative disease.},

Concerted reorientation of two adjacent peptides swings the central sidechain perpendicular to the chain direction, changing accessible sidechain conformations while leaving flanking structure undisturbed. Alternate conformations in sub-1 angstroms crystal structures show backrub motions for two-thirds of the significant Cbeta shifts and 3\% of the total residues in these proteins (126/3882), accompanied by two-state changes in sidechain rotamer. The Backrub modeling tool is effective in crystallographic rebuilding. For homology modeling or protein redesign, backrubs can provide realistic, small perturbations to rigid backbones.

AWSEM contains physically motivated terms, such as hydrogen bonding, as well as a bioinformatically based local structure biasing term, which efficiently takes into account many-body effects that are modulated by the local sequence. When combined with appropriate local or global alignments to choose memories, AWSEM can be used to perform de novo protein structure prediction. Herein we present structure prediction results for a particular choice of local sequence alignment method based on short residue sequences called fragments. We demonstrate the model's structure prediction capabilities for three levels of global homology between the target sequence and those proteins used for local structure biasing, all of which assume that the structure of the target sequence is not known. When there are no homologues in the database of structures used for local structure biasing, AWSEM calculations produce structural predictions that are somewhat improved compared with prior works using related approaches. The inclusion of a small number of structures from homologous sequences improves structure prediction only marginally, but when the fragment search is restricted to only homologous sequences, AWSEM can perform high resolution structure prediction and can be used for kinetics and dynamics studies.},

abstract = {Desensitization is an important mechanism curtailing the activity of ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs). Although the structural basis of desensitization is not fully resolved, it is thought to be governed by physicochemical properties of bound ligands. Here, we show the importance of an allosteric cation-binding pocket in controlling transitions between activated and desensitized states of rat kainate-type (KAR) ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). Tethering a positive charge to this pocket sustains KAR activation, preventing desensitization, whereas mutations that disrupt cation binding eliminate channel gating. These different outcomes explain the structural distinction between deactivation and desensitization. Deactivation occurs when the ligand unbinds before the cation, whereas desensitization proceeds if a ligand is bound without cation pocket occupancy. This sequence of events is absent from AMPA-type iGluRs; thus, cations are identified as gatekeepers of KAR gating, a role unique among even closely related LGICs.},

A wide range of co-evolution-inspired computational methods has been designed to predict molecular interactions, but it is only recently that important advances have been made. Breakthroughs in the handling of phylogenetic information and in disentangling indirect relationships have resulted in an improved capacity to predict interactions between proteins and contacts between different protein residues. Here, we review the main co-evolution-based computational approaches, their theoretical basis, potential applications and foreseeable developments.},

abstract = {Negative phi-values, which arise, for example, when a mutation stabilizes the folding transition state while destabilizing the native state, have been the focus of significant theoretical interest. Here we survey the experimental folding kinetics literature to ascertain the frequency with which negative phi-values occur in two-state proteins and describe the detailed experimental characterization of a negative phi-value previously reported to be among the most statistically significant. We find that, while almost 9\% of more than 500 reported phi-values (from a set of 16, well-characterized two-state proteins) fall below zero, many of these do not represent statistically significant observations. For example, only 6\% of the phi-values for which estimates of precision are available fall even one reported "error bar" below zero, and only 4\% are simultaneously negative, significant at this level and associated with free energy changes at or above 2.5 kJ/mol (below which phi-value analysis is widely considered unreliable). Moreover, given the asymmetric distribution of phi-values around zero and given that reported error bars may significantly underestimate true confidence intervals, the actual number of negative phi-values may be much smaller still. We have also performed detailed characterization of one of the most statistically significant negative phi-values reported in the literature to date, the V55F mutant of FynSH3. We find that substitution of the wild-type valine to other hydrophobic residues often increases folding rates without significantly altering folding free energy. This in turn leads to poorly defined phi-values, some of which are formally negative but only one or two of which fall statistically significantly below zero. In contrast, substitution to polar residues significantly destabilizes both the transition and native states, generally producing small but statistically significant positive phi-values of approximately 0.1. Thus, unlike other previously characterized phi-values, the negative phi-value associated with position 55 of the FynSH3 domain appears to be strongly dependent on the substitution employed to measure it, suggesting that subtlety will be required in order to develop a theoretical model of such behavior.},

abstract = {Helix formation is an elementary process in protein folding, influencing both the rate and mechanism of the global folding reaction. Yet, because helix formation is less cooperative than protein folding, the kinetics are often multiexponential, and the observed relaxation times are not straightforwardly related to the microscopic rates for helix nucleation and elongation. Recent ultrafast spectroscopic measurements on the peptide Ac-WAAAH(+)-NH(2) were best fit by two relaxation modes on the ∼0.1-1 ns time scale, (1) apparently much faster than had previously been experimentally inferred for helix nucleation. Here, we use replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations with an optimized all-atom protein force field (Amber ff03w) and an accurate water model (TIP4P/2005) to study the kinetics of helix formation in this peptide. We calculate temperature-dependent microscopic rate coefficients from the simulations by treating the dynamics between helical states as a Markov process using a recently developed formalism. The fluorescence relaxation curves obtained from simulated temperature jumps are in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined results. We find that the kinetics are multiphasic but can be approximated well by a double-exponential function. The major processes contributing to the relaxation are the shrinking of helical states at the C-terminal end and a faster re-equilibration among coil states. Despite the fast observed relaxation, the helix nucleation time is estimated from our model to be 20-70 ns at 300 K, with a dependence on temperature well described by Arrhenius kinetics.},

abstract = {An intriguing feature of protein folding is that the overall behavior obeys simple physical rules, but the finer details show a great deal of complexity. The scaling of thermodynamic and kinetic properties with protein size is one such rule. However, it is not clear to what extent biologically relevant folding properties (i.e., rates and stabilities) depend on size and/or on other factors such as structure and amino acid sequence. Here we address this question analyzing experimental data on 52 nonmultistate folding proteins with a simple theoretical model. We find that size scaling is the primary factor in determining folding rates, and more surprisingly also protein stability. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the experimental deviations from size predictions are due to minute differences in the fundamental parameters (e.g., less than 2\% for the stability). Folding is thus highly sensitive to little changes in protein energetics, but at the same time the folding properties of natural proteins are remarkably homogeneous. These results suggest that evolution has selected a small subset of possibilities from the physically plausible folding catalog and highlight the need for highly accurate protein force fields to predict rates and stabilities beyond general trends.},

abstract = {Recent experiments on protein-folding dynamics have revealed strong evidence for internal friction effects. That is, observed relaxation times are not simply proportional to the solvent viscosity as might be expected if the solvent were the only source of friction. However, a molecular interpretation of this remarkable phenomenon is currently lacking. Here, we use all-atom simulations of peptide and protein folding in explicit solvent, to probe the origin of the unusual viscosity dependence. We find that an important contribution to this effect, explaining the viscosity dependence of helix formation and the folding of a helix-containing protein, is the insensitivity of torsion angle isomerization to solvent friction. The influence of this landscape roughness can, in turn, be quantitatively explained by a rate theory including memory friction. This insensitivity of local barrier crossing to solvent friction is expected to contribute to the viscosity dependence of folding rates in larger proteins.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the potential impact of adjustment policies of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on the vulnerability of women and children to HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. A conceptual framework, composed of five different pathways of causation, is used for the evaluation. These five pathways connect changes at the macro level (e.g. removal of food subsidies) with effects at the meso (e.g. higher food prices) and micro levels (e.g. exposure of women and children to commercial sex) that influence the vulnerability of women and children to HIV/AIDS. Published literature on adjustment policies and socioeconomic determinants of HIV/AIDS among women and children in sub-Saharan Africa was reviewed to explore the cause-effect relationships included in the theoretical framework. Evidence suggests that adjustment policies may inadvertently produce conditions facilitating the exposure of women and children to HIV/AIDS. Complex research designs are needed to further investigate this relationship. A shift in emphasis from an individual approach to a socioeconomic approach in the study of HIV infection among women and children in the developing world is suggested. Given the potential for adjustment policies to exacerbate the AIDS pandemic among women and children, a careful examination of the effects of these policies on maternal and child welfare is urgently needed.},

abstract = {Glasses are disordered materials that lack the periodicity of crystals but behave mechanically like solids. The most common way of making a glass is by cooling a viscous liquid fast enough to avoid crystallization. Although this route to the vitreous state-supercooling-has been known for millennia, the molecular processes by which liquids acquire amorphous rigidity upon cooling are not fully understood. Here we discuss current theoretical knowledge of the manner in which intermolecular forces give rise to complex behaviour in supercooled liquids and glasses. An intriguing aspect of this behaviour is the apparent connection between dynamics and thermodynamics. The multidimensional potential energy surface as a function of particle coordinates (the energy landscape) offers a convenient viewpoint for the analysis and interpretation of supercooling and glass-formation phenomena. That much of this analysis is at present largely qualitative reflects the fact that precise computations of how viscous liquids sample their landscape have become possible only recently.},

abstract = {Although allostery draws increasing attention, not much is known about allosteric mechanisms. Here we argue that in all proteins, allosteric signals transmit through multiple, pre-existing pathways; which pathways dominate depend on protein topologies, specific binding events, covalent modifications, and cellular (environmental) conditions. Further, perturbation events at any site on the protein surface (or in the interior) will not create new pathways but only shift the pre-existing ensemble of pathways. Drugs binding at different sites or mutational events in disease shift the ensemble toward the same conformations; however, the relative populations of the different states will change. Consequently the observed functional, conformational, and dynamic effects will be different. This is the origin of allosteric functional modulation in dynamic proteins: allostery does not necessarily need to invoke conformational rearrangements to control protein activity and pre-existing pathways are always defaulted to during allostery regardless of the stimulant and perturbation site in the protein.},

One approach is to target certain domains within proteins that mediate these interactions. One example of such a domain is the PDZ domain, which is involved in interactions between many different proteins in a variety of cellular contexts. Because PDZ domains have well-defined binding sites, they are promising targets for drug discovery. However, there is still much to learn about the function of these domains before drugs targeting PDZ interactions can become a reality.},

abstract = {The ankyrin repeat (AR) domain of I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ consists of a cooperative folding unit of roughly four ARs (AR1-AR4) and of two weakly folded repeats (AR5 and AR6). The kinetic folding mechanism of the cooperative subdomain, I$\kappa$B$\alpha$(67-206), was analyzed using rapid mixing techniques. Despite its apparent architectural simplicity, I$\kappa$B$\alpha$(67-206) displays complex folding kinetics, with two sequential on-pathway high-energy intermediates. The effect of mutations to or away from the consensus sequences of ARs on folding behavior was analyzed, particularly the GXTPLHLA motif, which have not been examined in detail previously. Mutations toward the consensus generally resulted in an increase in folding stability, whereas mutations away from the consensus resulted in decreased overall stability. We determined the free energy change upon mutation for three sequential transition state ensembles along the folding route for 16 mutants. We show that folding initiates with the formation of the interface of the outer helices of AR3 and AR4, and then proceeds to consolidate structure in these repeats. Subsequently, AR1 and AR2 fold in a concerted way in a single kinetic step. We show that this mechanism is robust to the presence of AR5 and AR6 as they do not strongly affect the folding kinetics. Overall, the protein appears to fold on a rather smooth energy landscape, where the folding mechanism conforms a one-dimensional approximation. However, we note that the AR does not necessarily act as a single folding element.},

abstract = {How does a protein find its native state without a globally exhaustive search? We propose the "HZ" (hydrophobic zipper) hypothesis: hydrophobic contacts act as constraints that bring other contacts into spatial proximity, which then further constrain and zip up the next contacts, etc. In contrast to helix-coil cooperativity, HZ-heteropolymer collapse cooperativity is driven by nonlocal interactions, causes sheet and irregular conformations in addition to helices, leads to secondary structures concurrently with early hydrophobic core formation, is much more sequence dependent than helix-coil processes, and involves compact intermediate states that have much secondary--but little tertiary--structure. Hydrophobic contacts in the 1992 Protein Data Bank have the type of "topological localness" predicted by the hypothesis. The HZ paths for amino acid sequences that mimic crambin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor are quickly found by computer; the best configurations thus reached have single hydrophobic cores that are within about 3 kcal/mol of the global minimum. This hypothesis shows how proteins could find globally optimal states without exhaustive search.},

abstract = {The denatured "state" of a protein is a distribution of many different molecular conformations, the averages of which are measured by experiments. The properties of this ensemble depend sensitively on the solution conditions. There is now considerable evidence that even in strong denaturants such as 6M GuHC1 and 9M urea, some structure may remain in protein chains. Under milder or physiological conditions, the denatured states of most proteins appear to be highly compact with extensive secondary structure. Both theoretical and experimental studies suggest that hydrophobic interactions, chain conformational entropies, and electrostatic forces are dominant in determining this structure. The denaturation reaction of many proteins in GuHC1 or urea can be most simply modelled as a two-state transition between the native structure and a relatively compact denatured state, which then undergoes a gradual increase in radius on further addition of denaturant. However, when a protein acquires a large net charge in acids or bases, it can have two stable denatured populations, one compact and the other more highly unfolded. The prediction and elucidation of the structural details of the non-native states of proteins may ultimately prove to be as difficult as predicting the native structures, particularly for D0, the denatured state under physiological conditions. Just as with the native state, the structure of this biologically important denatured state appears to depend on the amino acid sequence. The development of synthetic, peptide and protein fragment models of the denatured state and the recent progress in NMR spectroscopy provide bases for optimism that new insights will be gained into this poorly understood realm of protein biochemistry.},

Folding codes are now being used to successfully design proteins and non-biological foldable polymers; aided by the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Structure Prediction (CASP) competition, protein structure prediction has now become quite good.

Based on results from our studies and others, we propose that structures of the domain-swapped proteins are mainly determined by their native topologies. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of seven different proteins, known to undergo domain swapping experimentally, under mildly denaturing conditions and found in all cases that the domain-swapped structures can be recapitulated by using protein topology in a simple protein model. Our studies further indicated that, in many cases, domain swapping occurs at positions around which the protein tends to unfold prior to complete unfolding. This, in turn, enabled prediction of protein structural elements that are responsible for domain swapping. In particular, two distinct domain-swapped dimer conformations of the focal adhesion targeting domain of focal adhesion kinase were predicted computationally and were supported experimentally by data obtained from NMR analyses.},

abstract = {The folding ability of a heteropolymer model for proteins subject to Monte Carlo dynamics on a simple cubic lattice is shown to be strongly correlated with the stability of the native state. We consider a number of estimates of the stability that can be determined without simulation, including the energy gap between the native state and the structurally dissimilar part of the spectrum (Z score) and, for sequences with fully compact native states, the gap in energy between the native and first excited fully compact states. These estimates are found to be more robust predictors of folding ability than a parameter sigma that requires simulation for its evaluation: sigma = 1 - Tf/Ttheta, where Tf is the temperature at which the fluctuation of an order parameter is at its maximum and Ttheta is the temperature at which the specific heat is at its maximum. We show that the interpretation of Ttheta as the collapse transition temperature is not correct in general and that the correlation between sigma and the folding ability arises from the fact that sigma is related to the energy gap (Z score).},

abstract = {Spectrin repeats are three-helix bundle structures which occur in a large number of diverse proteins, either as single copies or in tandem arrangements of multiple repeats. They can serve structural purposes, by coordination of cytoskeletal interactions with high spatial precision, as well as a 'switchboard' for interactions with multiple proteins with a more regulatory role. We describe the structure of the alpha-actinin spectrin repeats as a prototypical example, their assembly in a defined antiparallel dimer, and the interactions of spectrin repeats with multiple other proteins. The alpha-actinin rod domain shares several features common to other spectrin repeats. (1) The rod domain forms a rigid connection between two actin-binding domains positioned at the two ends of the alpha-actinin dimer. The exact distance and rigidity are important, for example, for organizing the muscle Z-line and maintaining its architecture during muscle contraction. (2) The spectrin repeats of alpha-actinin have evolved to make tight antiparallel homodimer contacts. (3) The spectrin repeats are important interaction sites for multiple structural and signalling proteins. The interactions of spectrin repeats are, however, diverse and defy any simple classification of their preferred interaction sites, which is possible for other domains (e.g. src-homology domains 3 or 2). Nevertheless, the binding properties of the repeats perform important roles in the biology of the proteins where they are found, and lead to the assembly of complex, multiprotein structures involved both in cytoskeletal architecture as well as in forming large signal transduction complexes.},

abstract = {The folding of many small proteins is kinetically a two-state process that represents overcoming the major free-energy barrier. A kinetic characteristic of a conformation, its probability to descend to the native state domain in the amount of time that represents a small fraction of total folding time, has been introduced to determine to which side of the free-energy barrier a conformation belongs. However, which features make a protein conformation on the folding pathway become committed to rapidly descending to the native state has been a mystery. Using two small, well characterized proteins, CI2 and C-Src SH3, we show how topological properties of protein conformations determine their kinetic ability to fold. We use a macroscopic measure of the protein contact network topology, the average graph connectivity, by constructing graphs that are based on the geometry of protein conformations. We find that the average connectivity is higher for conformations with a high folding probability than for those with a high probability to unfold. Other macroscopic measures of protein structural and energetic properties such as radius of gyration, rms distance, solvent-accessible surface area, contact order, and potential energy fail to serve as predictors of the probability of a given conformation to fold.},

abstract = {A series of nine, frustrated, multidomain peptides is described in which forces favoring self-assembly into a nanofiber versus those favoring disassembly could be easily modified. The peptides are organized into an ABA block motif in which the central B block is composed of alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids (glutamine and leucine, respectively). This alternation allows the amino acid side chains to segregate on opposite sides of the peptide backbone when it is in a fully extended beta-sheet conformation. In water, packing between two such peptides stabilizes the extended conformation by satisfying the desire of the leucine side chains to exclude themselves from the aqueous environment. Once in this conformation intermolecular backbone hydrogen bonding can readily take place between additional peptides eventually growing into high aspect ratio fibers. B block assembly may continue infinitely or until monomeric peptides are depleted from solution which results in an insoluble precipitate. Block A consists of a variable number of positively charged lysine residues whose electrostatic repulsion at pH 7 works against the desire of the B block to assemble. Here we show that balancing the forces of block A against B allows the formation of controlled length, individually dispersed, and fully soluble nanofibers with a width of 6 +/- 1 nm and length of 120 +/- 30 nm. Analysis by infrared, circular dichroism, and vitreous ice cryo-transmission electron microscopy reveals that the relative sizes of blocks A and B dictate the peptide secondary structure which in turn controls the resulting nanostructure. The system described epitomizes the use of molecular frustration in the design of finite self-assembled structures. These materials, and ones based on their architecture, may find applications where nanostructured control over fiber architecture and chemical functionality is required.},

The X-ray crystallographic structures of the third PDZ domain from the synaptic protein PSD-95 in complex with and in the absence of its peptide ligand have been determined at 1.8 angstroms and 2.3 angstroms resolution, respectively. The structures reveal that a four-residue C-terminal stretch (X-Thr/Ser-X-Val-COO(-)) engages the PDZ domain through antiparallel main chain interactions with a beta sheet of the domain. Recognition of the terminal carboxylate group of the peptide is conferred by a cradle of main chain amides provided by a Gly-Leu-Gly-Phe loop as well as by an arginine side chain. Specific side chain interactions and a prominent hydrophobic pocket explain the selective recognition of the C-terminal consensus sequence.},

While backbone motions have long been considered essential for long-range information conveyance, side-chain motions have rarely been considered. In this work, we demonstrate their potential utility using Monte Carlo sampling of side-chain torsional angles on a fixed backbone to quantify correlations amongst side-chain inter-rotameric motions. Results indicate that long-range correlations of side-chain fluctuations can arise independently from several different types of interactions: steric repulsions, implicit solvent interactions, or hydrogen bonding and salt-bridge interactions. These robust correlations persist across the entire protein (up to 60 \AA in the case of calmodulin) and can propagate long-range changes in side-chain variability in response to single residue perturbations.},

abstract = {Cells in a developing embryo have no direct way of "measuring" their physical position. Through a variety of processes, however, the expression levels of multiple genes come to be correlated with position, and these expression levels thus form a code for "positional information." We show how to measure this information, in bits, using the gap genes in the Drosophila embryo as an example. Individual genes carry nearly two bits of information, twice as much as would be expected if the expression patterns consisted only of on/off domains separated by sharp boundaries. Taken together, four gap genes carry enough information to define a cell's location with an error bar of \~{}1 along the anterior/posterior axis of the embryo. This precision is nearly enough for each cell to have a unique identity, which is the maximum information the system can use, and is nearly constant along the length of the embryo. We argue that this constancy is a signature of optimality in the transmission of information from primary morphogen inputs to the output of the gap gene network.},

abstract = {Dynamic force spectroscopy probes the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of single molecules and molecular assemblies. Here, we propose a simple procedure to extract kinetic information from such experiments. The cornerstone of our method is a transformation of the rupture-force histograms obtained at different force-loading rates into the force-dependent lifetimes measurable in constant-force experiments. To interpret the force-dependent lifetimes, we derive a generalization of Bell's formula that is formally exact within the framework of Kramers theory. This result complements the analytical expression for the lifetime that we derived previously for a class of model potentials. We illustrate our procedure by analyzing the nanopore unzipping of DNA hairpins and the unfolding of a protein attached by flexible linkers to an atomic force microscope. Our procedure to transform rupture-force histograms into the force-dependent lifetimes remains valid even when the molecular extension is a poor reaction coordinate and higher-dimensional free-energy surfaces must be considered. In this case the microscopic interpretation of the lifetimes becomes more challenging because the lifetimes can reveal richer, and even nonmonotonic, dependence on the force.},

abstract = {Receptor proteins in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have been found to form two-dimensional clusters in the plasma membrane. In this study, we examine the proposition that such clusters might show coordinated responses because of the spread of conformational states from one receptor to its neighbors. A Monte Carlo simulation was developed in which receptors flipped in probabilistic fashion between an active and an inactive state. Conformational energies depended on (i) ligand binding, (ii) a chemical modification of the receptor conferring adaptation, and (iii) the activity of neighboring receptors. Rate constants were based on data from known biological receptors, especially the bacterial Tar receptor, and on theoretical constraints derived from an analogous Ising model. The simulated system showed a greatly enhanced sensitivity to external signals compared with a corresponding set of uncoupled receptors and was operational over a much wider range of ambient concentrations. These and other properties should make a lattice of conformationally coupled receptors ideally suited to act as a "nose" by which a cell can detect and respond to extracellular stimuli.},

abstract = {We recently suggested that the sensitivity and range of a cluster of membrane receptors in bacteria would be enhanced by cooperative interactions between neighbouring proteins. Here, we examine the consequences of this "conformational spread" mechanism for an idealised one-dimensional system comprising a closed ring of identical allosteric protomers (protein molecules, or a group of protein domains operating as a unit). We show analytically and by means of Monte Carlo simulations that a ring of allosteric protomers can exhibit a switch-like response to changes in ligand concentration. We derive expressions for the sensitivity and cooperativity of switching and show that the maximum sensitivity is proportional to the number of protomers in the ring. A ring of this kind can reproduce the sensitivity and kinetics of the switch complex of a bacterial flagellar motor, for example, which is based on a ring of 34 FliM proteins. We also compare smaller rings of conformationally coupled protomers to classical allosteric proteins such as haemoglobin and show that the canonical MWC and KNF models arise naturally as limiting cases. Conformational spread appears to be a natural extension of the familiar mechanism of allostery: a physically realistic mechanism that should apply widely to many structures built from protein molecules.},

abstract = {Biomolecules are highly pressure-sensitive, but their dynamics upon return to ambient pressure are often too fast to observe with existing approaches. We describe a sample-efficient method capable of large and very fast pressure drops (<1 nanomole, >2,500 atmospheres and <0.7 microseconds). We validated the method by fluorescence-detected refolding of a genetically engineered lambda repressor mutant from its pressure-denatured state. We resolved barrierless structure formation upon return to ambient pressure; we observed a 2.1 +/- 0.7 microsecond refolding time, which is very close to the 'speed limit' for proteins and much faster than the corresponding temperature-jump refolding of the same protein. The ability to experimentally perform a large and very fast pressure drop opens up a new region of the biomolecular energy landscape for atomic-level simulation.},

Comparison with in vitro experiments at 23-49 degrees C showed that the cell environment influences protein stability and folding rate.

abstract = {The focus in protein folding has been very much on the protein backbone and sidechains. However, hydration waters make comparable contributions to the structure and energy of proteins. The coupling between fast hydration dynamics and protein dynamics is considered to play an important role in protein folding. Fundamental questions of protein hydration include, how far out into the solvent does the influence of the biomolecule reach, how is the water affected, and how are the properties of the hydration water influenced by the separation between protein molecules in solution? We show here that Terahertz spectroscopy directly probes such solvation dynamics around proteins, and determines the width of the dynamical hydration layer. We also investigate the dependence of solvation dynamics on protein concentration. We observe an unexpected nonmonotonic trend in the measured terahertz absorbance of the five helix bundle protein lambda(6-85)* as a function of the protein: water molar ratio. The trend can be explained by overlapping solvation layers around the proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate water dynamics in the solvation layer around one protein to be distinct from bulk water out to approximately 10 A. At higher protein concentrations such that solvation layers overlap, the calculated absorption spectrum varies nonmonotonically, qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations. The experimental data suggest an influence on the correlated water network motion beyond 20 A, greater than the pure structural correlation length usually observed.},

abstract = {Protein chains undergo conformational diffusion during folding and dynamics, experiencing both thermal kicks and viscous drag. Recent experiments have shown that the corresponding friction can be separated into wet friction, which is determined by the solvent viscosity, and dry friction, where frictional effects arise due to the interactions within the protein chain. Despite important advances, the molecular origins underlying dry friction in proteins have remained unclear. To address this problem, we studied the dynamics of the unfolded cold-shock protein at different solvent viscosities and denaturant concentrations. Using extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations we estimated the internal friction time scales and found them to agree well with the corresponding experimental measurements (Soranno et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012, 109, 17800-17806). Analysis of the reconfiguration dynamics of the unfolded chain further revealed that hops in the dihedral space provide the dominant mechanism of internal friction. Furthermore, the increased number of concerted dihedral moves at physiological conditions suggest that, in such conditions, the concerted motions result in higher frictional forces. These findings have important implications for understanding the folding kinetics of proteins as well as the dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins.},

abstract = {Certain proteins undergo a substantial conformational change in response to a given stimulus. This conformational change can manifest in different manners and result in an actuation, that is, catalytic or signalling event, movement, interaction with other proteins, and so on. In all cases, the sensing-actuation process of proteins is initiated by a recognition event that translates into a mechanical action. Thus, proteins are ideal components for designing new nanomaterials that are intelligent and can perform desired mechanical actions in response to target stimuli. A number of approaches have been undertaken to mimic nature's sensing-actuating process. We now report a new hybrid material that integrates genetically engineered proteins within hydrogels capable of producing a stimulus-responsive action mechanism. The mechanical effect is a result of an induced conformational change and binding affinities of the protein in response to a stimulus. The stimuli-responsive hydrogel exhibits three specific swelling stages in response to various ligands offering additional fine-tuned control over a conventional two-stage swelling hydrogel. The newly prepared material was used in the sensing, and subsequent gating and transport of biomolecules across a polymer network, demonstrating its potential application in microfluidics and miniaturized drug-delivery systems.},

abstract = {Periodicities in the polar/apolar character of the amino acid sequence of a protein can be examined by assigning to each residue a numerical hydrophobicity and searching for periodicity in the resulting one-dimensional function. The strength of each periodic component is the quantity that has been termed the hydrophobic moment. When proteins of known three-dimensional structure are examined, it is found that sequences that form alpha helices tend to have, on average, a strong periodicity in the hydrophobicity of 3.6 residues, the period of the alpha helix. Similarly, many sequences that form strands of beta sheets tend to have a periodicity in their hydrophobicity of about 2.3 residues, the period typical of beta structure. Also, the few sequences known to form 3(10) helices display a periodicity of about 2.5 residues, not far from the period of 3 for an ideal 3(10) helix. This means that many protein sequences tend to form the periodic structure that maximizes their amphiphilicity. This observation suggests that the periodicity of the hydrophobicity of the protein primary structure is a factor in the formation of secondary structures. Moreover, the observation that many protein sequences tend to form segments of maximum amphiphilicity suggests that segments of secondary structure fold at a hydrophobic surface, probably formed from other parts of the folding protein.},

abstract = {Comparative studies of the proteomes from different organisms have provided valuable information about protein domain distribution in the kingdoms of life. Earlier studies have been limited by the fact that only about 50\% of the proteomes could be matched to a domain. Here, we have extended these studies by including less well-defined domain definitions, Pfam-B and clustered domains, MAS, in addition to Pfam-A and SCOP domains. It was found that a significant fraction of these domain families are homologous to Pfam-A or SCOP domains. Further, we show that all regions that do not match a Pfam-A or SCOP domain contain a significantly higher fraction of disordered structure. These unstructured regions may be contained within orphan domains or function as linkers between structured domains. Using several different definitions we have re-estimated the number of multi-domain proteins in different organisms and found that several methods all predict that eukaryotes have approximately 65\% multi-domain proteins, while the prokaryotes consist of approximately 40\% multi-domain proteins. However, these numbers are strongly dependent on the exact choice of cut-off for domains in unassigned regions. In conclusion, all eukaryotes have similar fractions of multi-domain proteins and disorder, whereas a high fraction of repeating domain is distinguished only in multicellular eukaryotes. This implies a role for repeats in cell-cell contacts while the other two features are important for intracellular functions.},

abstract = {The outstanding challenges in computer simulations of biological macromolecules are related to their complexity. Part of the complexity of biological systems concerns their physical size. Enumerating atoms ranging from a few in small signal molecules to the millions of particles in biological complexes is an obvious example of biological hierarchy. Another aspect is the extremely broad range of timescales of life science processes (many orders of magnitude); this adds another dimension of complexity. This extended range of timescales may even be observed for a single biomolecular process. Consider, for example, the R to T transition in hemoglobin. The complete conformational change occurs in tens of microseconds. However, the system has more than one timescale. Considerable activity occurs on a range of timescales before the final event (heme relaxation, picoseconds; tertiary relaxation, nanoseconds; ligand escape from the protein matrix and rebinding, hundreds of nanoseconds and so on). Whereas the basic time-step of atomically detailed simulations is about a femtosecond, it is not difficult to find molecular processes in biology that span more than ten orders of magnitude of relevant times, making the straightforward simulation of these events very difficult. Several techniques have been developed in recent years to address these problems.},

We find that the minimum value for the physically allowed rate of heat production is determined by the growth rate, internal entropy, and durability of the replicator, and we discuss the implications of this finding for bacterial cell division, as well as for the pre-biotic emergence of self-replicating nucleic acids.},

abstract = {How do proteins fold, and why do they fold in that way? This Perspective integrates earlier and more recent advances over the 50-y history of the protein folding problem, emphasizing unambiguously clear structural information. Experimental results show that, contrary to prior belief, proteins are multistate rather than two-state objects. They are composed of separately cooperative foldon building blocks that can be seen to repeatedly unfold and refold as units even under native conditions. Similarly, foldons are lost as units when proteins are destabilized to produce partially unfolded equilibrium molten globules. In kinetic folding, the inherently cooperative nature of foldons predisposes the thermally driven amino acid-level search to form an initial foldon and subsequent foldons in later assisted searches. The small size of foldon units, ∼20 residues, resolves the Levinthal time-scale search problem. These microscopic-level search processes can be identified with the disordered multitrack search envisioned in the "new view" model for protein folding. Emergent macroscopic foldon-foldon interactions then collectively provide the structural guidance and free energy bias for the ordered addition of foldons in a stepwise pathway that sequentially builds the native protein. These conclusions reconcile the seemingly opposed new view and defined pathway models; the two models account for different stages of the protein folding process. Additionally, these observations answer the "how" and the "why" questions. The protein folding pathway depends on the same foldon units and foldon-foldon interactions that construct the native structure.},

abstract = {Two fundamentally different views of how proteins fold are now being debated. Do proteins fold through multiple unpredictable routes directed only by the energetically downhill nature of the folding landscape or do they fold through specific intermediates in a defined pathway that systematically puts predetermined pieces of the target native protein into place? It has now become possible to determine the structure of protein folding intermediates, evaluate their equilibrium and kinetic parameters, and establish their pathway relationships. Results obtained for many proteins have serendipitously revealed a new dimension of protein structure. Cooperative structural units of the native protein, called foldons, unfold and refold repeatedly even under native conditions. Much evidence obtained by hydrogen exchange and other methods now indicates that cooperative foldon units and not individual amino acids account for the unit steps in protein folding pathways. The formation of foldons and their ordered pathway assembly systematically puts native-like foldon building blocks into place, guided by a sequential stabilization mechanism in which prior native-like structure templates the formation of incoming foldons with complementary structure. Thus the same propensities and interactions that specify the final native state, encoded in the amino-acid sequence of every protein, determine the pathway for getting there. Experimental observations that have been interpreted differently, in terms of multiple independent pathways, appear to be due to chance misfolding errors that cause different population fractions to block at different pathway points, populate different pathway intermediates, and fold at different rates. This paper summarizes the experimental basis for these three determining principles and their consequences. Cooperative native-like foldon units and the sequential stabilization process together generate predetermined stepwise pathways. Optional misfolding errors are responsible for 3-state and heterogeneous kinetic folding.},

Employing the nerve growth factor (NGF)-responsive cell line, PC12, we have used sense and antisense DNA transfection strategies to examine the role of the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau in several aspects of neuronal cell behavior. Stable transfectants over-expressing tau accumulate more microtubule mass and extend neurites more rapidly than control cells, while transfectants under-expressing tau exhibit reduced microtubule levels and slower neurite outgrowth. Further, tau over-expressing cells are markedly more resistant to nocodazole-induced neuritic degeneration when compared to wild-type or tau under-expressing cells. These observations provide direct support for the model that tau is capable of influencing: (i) net microtubule assembly, (ii) the rate of neurite elongation and (iii) neuritic stability. These capabilities suggest that tau plays crucial roles in the development and maintenance of neuronal cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: 153 mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene have been claimed to be associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in familial and sporadic ALS in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern with complete or reduced penetrance. The authors now report four ALS pedigrees from Finland, France, Germany and Sweden with either the D90A or E100K SOD1 mutations in some but not all affected members. After re-collecting DNA, the non-segregation of the SOD1 mutations with disease was confirmed by three independent laboratories using different PCR primers: while some of the affected patients carry SOD1 mutations, other affected family members have two wildtype/normal SOD1 genes. In addition, some unaffected members within the same families are carriers of SOD1 gene mutations. To exclude other known genetic causes, the authors ruled out mutations within the genes coding for VAPB, ANG, TDP43, FUS and DCTN1 in affected individuals in the four pedigrees. CONCLUSIONS: The authors find that the D90A and E100K SOD1 gene mutations found in some patients are not the exclusive cause of ALS in these pedigrees. Whether this is also the case for the other 151 SOD1 mutations reported in ALS pedigrees is unknown. The findings have consequences for genetic testing in clinical practice when diagnosing ALS and for genetic counselling in ALS. Some SOD1 mutations may be part of an oligo- or epigentic pattern of inheritance. Such a pattern of inheritance may model other oligo- or polygenetic traits responsible for other forms of ALS.},

abstract = {The primary driving force for protein folding is the sequestration of hydrophobic side chains from solvent water, but the means whereby the amino acid sequence directs the folding process to form the correct final folded state is not well understood. Measurements of NMR line broadening in spin-labeled samples of unfolded apomyoglobin at pH 2.3 have been used to derive a quantitative model for transient hydrophobic interactions between various sites in the polypeptide chain, as would occur during the initiation of protein folding. Local clusters of residues with high values for the parameter "average area buried upon folding" (AABUF) form foci not only for local contacts but for long-range interactions, the relative frequencies of which can be understood in terms of differences in the extent of reduction in chain configurational entropy that occurs upon formation of nonlocal contacts. These results complement the striking correlation previously observed between the kinetic folding process of apomyoglobin and the AABUF of its amino acid sequence [Nishimura C, Lietzow MA, Dyson HJ, Wright PE (2005) J Mol Biol 351:383-392]. For the acid-unfolded states of apomyoglobin, our approach identifies multiple distinct hydrophobic clusters of differing thermodynamic stability. The most structured of these clusters, although sparsely populated, have both native-like and nonnative character; the specificity of the transient long-range contacts observed in these states suggests that they play a key role in initiating chain collapse and folding.},

abstract = {Protein motions are essential for function. Comparing protein processes with the dielectric fluctuations of the surrounding solvent shows that they fall into two classes: nonslaved and slaved. Nonslaved processes are independent of the solvent motions; their rates are determined by the protein conformation and vibrational dynamics. Slaved processes are tightly coupled to the solvent; their rates have approximately the same temperature dependence as the rate of the solvent fluctuations, but they are smaller. Because the temperature dependence is determined by the activation enthalpy, we propose that the solvent is responsible for the activation enthalpy, whereas the protein and the hydration shell control the activation entropy through the energy landscape. Bond formation is the prototype of nonslaved processes; opening and closing of channels are quintessential slaved motions. The prevalence of slaved motions highlights the importance of the environment in cells and membranes for the function of proteins.},

abstract = {We describe a computational solvation model called semi-explicit assembly (SEA). SEA water captures much of the physics of explicit-solvent models but with computational speeds approaching those of implicit-solvent models. We use an explicit-water model to precompute properties of water solvation shells around simple spheres, then assemble a solute's solvation shell by combining the shells of these spheres. SEA improves upon implicit-solvent models of solvation free energies by accounting for local solute curvature, accounting for near-neighbor nonadditivities, and treating water's dipole as being asymmetrical with respect to positive or negative solute charges. SEA does not involve parameter fitting, because parameters come from the given underlying explicit-solvation model. SEA is about as accurate as explicit simulations as shown by comparisons against four different homologous alkyl series, a set of 504 varied solutes, solutes taken retrospectively from two solvation-prediction events, and a hypothetical polar-solute series, and SEA is about 100-fold faster than Poisson-Boltzmann calculations.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to computer modeling of solvation free energies of oil in water. In Semi-Explicit Assembly, we first precompute structural and thermal properties of TIP3P waters around different Lennard-Jones spheres. This tabulated information is then used to compute the nonpolar solvation properties of arbitrary solutes. By accumulating interactions from whole regions of the solute molecule, Semi-Explicit Assembly more properly accounts for effects of solute shape and solves problems that appear as nonadditivities in traditional gammaA approaches. Semi-Explicit Assembly involves little parameter fitting because the solute and water properties are taken from existing force fields. We tested the predictions on alkanes, alkynes, linear and planar polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and on a diverse set of 504 molecules previously explored by explicit solvent simulations. We found that not all hydrocarbons are the same. Hydrocarbons have "hot spots", places where first-shell waters interact more strongly with the molecule than at other locations. For example, waters are more attracted to hover over hydrocarbon rings than at the edges. By accounting for these collective regional effects, Semi-Explicit Assembly approaches the physical accuracies of explicit solvent models in computing nonpolar solvation free energies, but because of the precomputations and the regional additivities, it is nearly as fast to compute as gammaA methods.},

abstract = {The variation in folding rate among single-domain natural proteins is tremendous, but common models with explicit representations of the protein chain are either demonstrably insufficient or unclear as to their capability for rationalizing the experimental diversity in folding rates. In view of the critical role of water exclusion in cooperative folding, we apply native-centric, coarse-grained chain modeling with elementary desolvation barriers to investigate solvation effects on folding rates. For a set of 13 proteins, folding rates simulated with desolvation barriers cover approximately 4.6 orders of magnitude, spanning a range essentially identical to that observed experimentally. In contrast, folding rates simulated without desolvation barriers cover only approximately 2.2 orders of magnitude. Following a Hammond-like trend, the folding transition-state ensemble (TSE) of a protein model with desolvation barriers generally has a higher average number of native contacts and is structurally more specific, that is, less diffused, than the TSE of the corresponding model without desolvation barriers. Folding is generally significantly slower in models with desolvation barriers because of their higher overall macroscopic folding barriers as well as slower conformational diffusion speeds in the TSE that are approximately 1/50 times those in models without desolvation barriers. Nonetheless, the average root-mean-square deviation between the TSE and the native conformation is often similar in the two modeling approaches, a finding suggestive of a more robust structural requirement for the folding rate-limiting step. The increased folding rate diversity in models with desolvation barriers originates from the tendency of these microscopic barriers to cause more heightening of the overall macroscopic folding free-energy barriers for proteins with more nonlocal native contacts than those with fewer such contacts. Thus, the enhancement of folding cooperativity by solvation effects is seen as positively correlated with a protein's native topological complexity.},

In the case of C8 we find the dynamics to be governed by torsional motions. For C16 and C24 we extract three global order parameters with which we characterize the fundamental dynamics, and determine that the low free-energy pathway of globular collapse proceeds by a "kink and slide" mechanism, whereby a bend near the end of the linear chain migrates toward the middle to form a hairpin and, ultimately, a coiled helix. The low-dimensional representation is subtly perturbed in the solvated phase relative to the ideal gas, and its geometric structure is conserved between C16 and C24. The methodology is directly extensible to biomolecular self-assembly processes, such as protein folding.},

We present an adaptation of a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique known as the diffusion map that extends its applicability to biased umbrella sampling simulation trajectories in which restraining potentials are employed to drive the system into high free energy regions and improve sampling of phase space.

abstract = {The kinetics and thermodynamics of the folding of the homologous four-helix proteins Im7 and Im9 have been characterised at pH 7.0 and 10 degrees C. These proteins are 60 \% identical in sequence and have the same three-dimensional structure, yet appear to fold by different kinetic mechanisms. The logarithm of the folding and unfolding rates of Im9 change linearly as a function of urea concentration and fit well to an equation describing a two-state mechanism (with a folding rate of 1500 s-1, an unfolding rate of 0. 01 s-1, and a highly compact transition state that has approximately 95 \% of the native surface area buried). By contrast, there is clear evidence for the population of an intermediate during the refolding of Im7, as indicated by a change in the urea dependence of the folding rate and the presence of a significant burst phase amplitude in the refolding kinetics. Under stabilising conditions (0.25 M Na2SO4, pH 7.0 and 10 degrees C) the folding of Im9 remains two-state, whilst under similar conditions (0.4 M Na2SO4, pH 7.0 and 10 degrees C) the intermediate populated during Im7 refolding is significantly stabilised (KUI=125). Equilibrium denaturation experiments, under the conditions used in the kinetic measurements, show that Im7 is significantly less stable than Im9 (DeltaDeltaG 9.3 kJ/mol) and the DeltaG and m values determined accord with those obtained from the fit to the kinetic data. The results show, therefore, that the population of an intermediate in the refolding of the immunity protein structure is defined by the precise amino acid sequence rather than the global stability of the protein. We discuss the possibility that the intermediate of Im7 is populated due to differences in helix propensity in Im7 and Im9 and the relevance of these data to the folding of helical proteins in general.},

abstract = {High amphiphilicity is a hallmark of interfacial helices in membrane proteins and membrane-active peptides, such as toxins and antimicrobial peptides. Although there is general agreement that amphiphilicity is important for membrane-interface binding, an unanswered question is its importance relative to simple hydrophobicity-driven partitioning. We have examined this fundamental question using measurements of the interfacial partitioning of a family of 17-residue amidated-acetylated peptides into both neutral and anionic lipid vesicles. Composed only of Ala, Leu, and Gln residues, the amino acid sequences of the peptides were varied to change peptide amphiphilicity without changing total hydrophobicity. We found that peptide helicity in water and interface increased linearly with hydrophobic moment, as did the favorable peptide partitioning free energy. This observation provides simple tools for designing amphipathic helical peptides. Finally, our results show that helical amphiphilicity is far more important for interfacial binding than simple hydrophobicity.},

abstract = {IkappaBalpha is the major regulator of transcription factor NF-kappaB function. The ankyrin repeat region of IkappaBalpha mediates specific interactions with NF-kappaB dimers, but ankyrin repeats 1, 5 and 6 display a highly dynamic character when not in complex with NF-kappaB. Using chemical denaturation, we show here that IkappaBalpha displays two folding transitions: a non-cooperative conversion under weak perturbation, and a major cooperative folding phase upon stronger insult. Taking advantage of a native Trp residue in ankyrin repeat (AR) 6 and engineered Trp residues in AR2, AR4 and AR5, we show that the cooperative transition involves AR2 and AR3, while the non-cooperative transition involves AR5 and AR6. The major structural transition can be affected by single amino acid substitutions converging to the "consensus" ankyrin repeat sequence, increasing the native state stability significantly. We further characterized the structural and dynamic properties of the native state ensemble of IkappaBalpha and the stabilized mutants by H/(2)H exchange mass spectrometry and NMR. The solution experiments were complemented with molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the microscopic origins of the stabilizing effect of the consensus substitutions, which can be traced to the fast conformational dynamics of the folded ensemble.},

Repeat-containing proteins self-organize into elongated non-globular structures. Do the same general underlying principles that dictate the folding of globular domains apply also to these extended topologies? Using a simplified structure-based model capturing a perfectly funneled energy landscape, we surveyed the predicted mechanism of folding for ankyrin repeat containing proteins. The ankyrin family is one of the most extensively studied classes of non-globular folds. The model based only on native contacts reproduces most of the experimental observations on the folding of these proteins, including a folding mechanism that is reminiscent of a nucleation propagation growth. The confluence of simulation and experimental results suggests that the folding of non-globular proteins is accurately described by a funneled energy landscape, in which topology plays a determinant role in the folding mechanism.},

Overall, strong energetic conflicts are minimized in native states satisfying the principle of minimal frustration. Local violations of this principle open up possibilities to form the complex multifunnel energy landscapes needed for large-scale conformational changes. We survey the local frustration patterns of allosteric domains and show that the regions that reconfigure are often enriched in patches of highly frustrated interactions, consistent both with the idea that these locally frustrated regions may act as specific hinges or that proteins may "crack" in these locations. On the other hand, the symmetry of multimeric protein assemblies allows near degeneracy by reconfiguring while maintaining minimally frustrated interactions. We also anecdotally examine some specific examples of complex conformational changes and speculate on the role of frustration in the kinetics of allosteric change.},

abstract = {I attempt to reconcile apparently conflicting factors and mechanisms that have been proposed to determine the rate constant for two-state folding of small proteins, on the basis of general features of the structures of transition states. Phi-Value analysis implies a transition state for folding that resembles an expanded and distorted native structure, which is built around an extended nucleus. The nucleus is composed predominantly of elements of partly or well-formed native secondary structure that are stabilized by local and long-range tertiary interactions. These long-range interactions give rise to connecting loops, frequently containing the native loops that are poorly structured. I derive an equation that relates differences in the contact order of a protein to changes in the length of linking loops, which, in turn, is directly related to the unfavorable free energy of the loops in the transition state. Kinetic data on loop extension mutants of CI2 and alpha-spectrin SH3 domain fit the equation qualitatively. The rate of folding depends primarily on the interactions that directly stabilize the nucleus, especially those in native-like secondary structure and those resulting from the entropy loss from the connecting loops, which vary with contact order. This partitioning of energy accounts for the success of some algorithms that predict folding rates, because they use these principles either explicitly or implicitly. The extended nucleus model thus unifies the observations of rate depending on both stability and topology.},

abstract = {Phi values are used to map structures of protein-folding transition states from changes in free energies of denaturation (DeltaDeltaG(D-N)) and activation on mutation. A recent reappraisal proposed that Phi values for DeltaDeltaG(D-N) < 1.7 kcal/mol are artifactual. On discarding such derived Phi values from published studies, the authors concluded that there are no high Phi values in diffuse transition states, which are consequently uniformly diffuse with no evidence for nucleation. However, values of DeltaDeltaG(D-N) > 1.7 kcal/mol are often found for large side chains that make dispersed tertiary interactions, especially in hydrophobic cores that are in the process of being formed in the transition state. Conversely, specific local interactions that probe secondary structure tend to have DeltaDeltaG(D-N) approximately 0.5-2 kcal/mol. Discarding Phi values from lower-energy changes discards the crucial information about local interactions and makes transition states appear uniformly diffuse by overemphasizing the dispersed tertiary interactions. The evidence for the 1.7 kcal/mol cutoff was based on mutations that had been deliberately designed to be unsuitable for Phi-value analysis because they are structurally disruptive. We confirm that reliable Phi values can be derived from the recommended mutations in suitable proteins with 0.6 < DeltaDeltaG(D-N) < 1.7 kcal/mol, and there are many reliable high Phi values. Transition states vary from being rather diffuse to being well formed with islands of near-complete secondary structure. We also confirm that the structures of transition-state ensembles can be perturbed by mutations with DeltaDeltaG(D-N) > 2 kcal/mol and that protein-folding transition states do move on the energy surface on mutation.},

abstract = {The role of native contact topology in the folding of a TIM barrel model based on the alpha-subunit of tryptophan synthase (alphaTS) from Salmonella typhimurium (Protein Data Bank structure 1BKS) was studied using both equilibrium and kinetic simulations. Equilibrium simulations of alphaTS reveal the population of two intermediate ensembles, I1 and I2, during unfolding/refolding at the folding temperature, Tf = 335 K. Equilibrium intermediate I1 demonstrates discrete structure in regions alpha0-beta6 whereas intermediate I2 is a loose ensemble of states with N-terminal structure varying from at least beta1-beta3 (denoted I2A) to alpha0-beta4 at most (denoted I2B). The structures of I1 and I2 match well with the two intermediate states detected in equilibrium folding experiments of Escherichia coli alphaTS. Kinetic folding simulations of alphaTS reveal the sequential population of four intermediate ensembles, I120Q, I200Q, I300Q, and I360Q, during refolding. Kinetic intermediates I120Q, I200Q, and I300Q are highly similar to equilibrium alphaTS intermediates I2A, I2B, and I1, respectively, consistent with kinetic experiments on alphaTS from E. coli. A small population (approximately 10\%) of kinetic trajectories are trapped in the I120Q intermediate ensemble and require a slow and complete unfolding step to properly refold. Both the on-pathway and off-pathway I120Q intermediates show structure in beta1-beta3, which is also strikingly consistent with kinetic folding experiments of alphaTS. In the off-pathway intermediate I(120Q), helix alpha2 is wrapped in a nonnative chiral arrangement around strand beta3, sterically preventing the subsequent folding step between beta3 and beta4. These results demonstrate the success of combining kinetic and equilibrium simulations of minimalist protein models to explore TIM barrel folding and the folding of other large proteins.},

@article{Finkelstein1997,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The problem of how a protein chain can find its most stable structure without exhaustive sorting of all its possible conformations is known as the 'Levinthal paradox'. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate this problem and to estimate the rate of folding to the most stable structure near the point of thermodynamic equilibrium between this structure and the coil. RESULTS: Folding is rapid when it occurs in the vicinity of a thermodynamic 'all-or-none' transition from the coil to the lowest-energy fold: here the misfolded and semifolded states cannot 'trap' the folding chain since, even taken together, all these states are less stable than both the initial coil and the final stable fold of the chain. A stable globular structure can be rapidly achieved via a 'nucleation-and-growth' folding pathway that provides a continuous entropy-by-energy compensation along the folding pathway and thus provides a low free energy of the transition state. CONCLUSIONS: At the point of transition of the coil to the lowest-energy fold, an N-residue chain folds normally in approximately exp(N2/3) ns. Therefore, a 100-residue chain finds its most stable fold within minutes rather than in 10(100) ps = 10(80) years, according to the famous paradoxical estimate of Levinthal.},

abstract = {The Gaussian-distributed random coil has been the dominant model for denatured proteins since the 1950s, and it has long been interpreted to mean that proteins are featureless, statistical coils in 6 M guanidinium chloride. Here, we demonstrate that random-coil statistics are not a unique signature of featureless polymers. The random-coil model does predict the experimentally determined coil dimensions of denatured proteins successfully. Yet, other equally convincing experiments have shown that denatured proteins are biased toward specific conformations, in apparent conflict with the random-coil model. We seek to resolve this paradox by introducing a contrived counterexample in which largely native protein ensembles nevertheless exhibit random-coil characteristics. Specifically, proteins of known structure were used to generate disordered conformers by varying backbone torsion angles at random for approximately 8\% of the residues; the remaining approximately 92\% of the residues remained fixed in their native conformation. Ensembles of these disordered structures were generated for 33 proteins by using a torsion-angle Monte Carlo algorithm with hard-sphere sterics; bulk statistics were then calculated for each ensemble. Despite this extreme degree of imposed internal structure, these ensembles have end-to-end distances and mean radii of gyration that agree well with random-coil expectations in all but two cases.},

@article{Fowler2001,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Do proteins that have the same structure fold by the same pathway even when they are unrelated in sequence? To address this question, we are comparing the folding of a number of different immunoglobulin-like proteins. Here, we present a detailed protein engineering phi value analysis of the folding pathway of TI I27, an immunoglobulin domain from human cardiac titin.

RESULTS: TI I27 folds rapidly via a kinetic intermediate that is destabilized by most mutations. The transition state for folding is remarkably native-like in terms of solvent accessibility. We use phi value analysis to map this transition state and show that it is highly structured; only a few residues close to the N-terminal region of the protein remain completely unfolded. Interestingly, most mutations cause the transition state to become less native-like. This anti-Hammond behavior can be used as a novel means of obtaining additional structural information about the transition state.

CONCLUSIONS: The residues that are involved in nucleating the folding of TI I27 are structurally equivalent to the residues that form the folding nucleus in an evolutionary unrelated fibronectin type III protein. These residues form part of the common structural core of Ig-like domains. The data support the hypothesis that interactions essential for defining the structure of these beta sandwich proteins are also important in nucleation of folding.},

@article{Frauenfelder2006,
abstract = {Proteins, the workhorses of living systems, are constructed from chains of amino acids, which are synthesized in the cell based on the instructions of the genetic code and then folded into working proteins. The time for folding varies from microseconds to hours. What controls the folding rate is hotly debated. We postulate here that folding has the same temperature dependence as the alpha-fluctuations in the bulk solvent but is much slower. We call this behavior slaving. Slaving has been observed in folded proteins: Large-scale protein motions follow the solvent fluctuations with rate coefficient k(alpha) but can be slower by a large factor. Slowing occurs because large-scale motions proceed in many small steps, each determined by k(alpha). If conformational motions of folded proteins are slaved, so a fortiori must be the motions during folding. The unfolded protein makes a Brownian walk in the conformational space to the folded structure, with each step controlled by k(alpha). Because the number of conformational substates in the unfolded protein is extremely large, the folding rate coefficient, k(f), is much smaller than k(alpha). The slaving model implies that the activation enthalpy of folding is dominated by the solvent, whereas the number of steps n(f) = k(alpha)/k(f) is controlled by the number of accessible substates in the unfolded protein and the solvent. Proteins, however, undergo not only alpha- but also beta-fluctuations. These additional fluctuations are local protein motions that are essentially independent of the bulk solvent fluctuations and may be relevant at late stages of folding.},

abstract = {Protein functions require conformational motions. We show here that the dominant conformational motions are slaved by the hydration shell and the bulk solvent. The protein contributes the structure necessary for function. We formulate a model that is based on experiments, insights from the physics of glass-forming liquids, and the concepts of a hierarchically organized energy landscape. To explore the effect of external fluctuations on protein dynamics, we measure the fluctuations in the bulk solvent and the hydration shell with broadband dielectric spectroscopy and compare them with internal fluctuations measured with the M\"{o}ssbauer effect and neutron scattering. The result is clear. Large-scale protein motions are slaved to the fluctuations in the bulk solvent. They are controlled by the solvent viscosity, and are absent in a solid environment. Internal protein motions are slaved to the beta fluctuations of the hydration shell, are controlled by hydration, and are absent in a dehydrated protein. The model quantitatively predicts the rapid increase of the mean-square displacement above approximately 200 K, shows that the external beta fluctuations determine the temperature- and time-dependence of the passage of carbon monoxide through myoglobin, and explains the nonexponential time dependence of the protein relaxation after photodissociation.},

We examine one such case, the human Pin1 WW domain, using the recently developed deactivated morphing method to calculate free energy differences between misfolded and folded states. We find that the force field we used favors the misfolded states, explaining the failure of the folding simulations.

Understanding the basis for protein-protein interactions requires the full characterization of the thermodynamics of their association. Historically it has been virtually impossible to experimentally estimate changes in protein conformational entropy, a potentially important component of the free energy of protein association. However, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing the dynamics of proteins. Here we employ changes in conformational dynamics as a proxy for corresponding changes in conformational entropy. We find that the change in internal dynamics of the protein calmodulin varies significantly on binding a variety of target domains. Surprisingly, the apparent change in the corresponding conformational entropy is linearly related to the change in the overall binding entropy. This indicates that changes in protein conformational entropy can contribute significantly to the free energy of protein-ligand association.},

abstract = {The "three sites per nucleotide" (3SPN) model provides a coarse-grained representation of nucleic acids for simulation of molecular processes. Previously, this model has relied on an implicit representation of the surrounding ionic environment at the level of Debye-Hückel theory. In this work, we eliminate this limitation and present an explicit representation of ions, both monovalent and divalent. The coarse-grain ion-ion and ion-phosphate potential energy functions are inferred from all-atom simulations and parameterized to reproduce key features of the local structure and organization of ions in bulk water and in the presence of DNA. The resulting model, 3SPN.1-I, is capable of reproducing the local structure observed in detailed atomistic simulations, as well as the experimental melting temperature of DNA for a range of DNA oligonucleotide lengths, CG-content, Na(+) concentration, and Mg(2+) concentration.},

abstract = {Biofilms, surface-bound communities of microbes, are economically and medically important due to their pathogenic and obstructive properties. Among the numerous strategies to prevent bacterial adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation, surface topography was recently proposed as a highly nonspecific method that does not rely on small-molecule antibacterial compounds, which promote resistance. Here, we provide a detailed investigation of how the introduction of submicrometer crevices to a surface affects attachment of Escherichia coli. These crevices reduce substrate surface area available to the cell body but increase overall surface area. We have found that, during the first 2 h, adhesion to topographic surfaces is significantly reduced compared with flat controls, but this behavior abruptly reverses to significantly increased adhesion at longer exposures. We show that this reversal coincides with bacterially induced wetting transitions and that flagellar filaments aid in adhesion to these wetted topographic surfaces. We demonstrate that flagella are able to reach into crevices, access additional surface area, and produce a dense, fibrous network. Mutants lacking flagella show comparatively reduced adhesion. By varying substrate crevice sizes, we determine the conditions under which having flagella is most advantageous for adhesion. These findings strongly indicate that, in addition to their role in swimming motility, flagella are involved in attachment and can furthermore act as structural elements, enabling bacteria to overcome unfavorable surface topographies. This work contributes insights for the future design of antifouling surfaces and for improved understanding of bacterial behavior in native, structured environments.},

abstract = {The four-helix protein Im7 folds through an on-pathway intermediate at pH 7.0 and 10 degrees C. By contrast, under these conditions there is no evidence for a populated intermediate in the folding of its more stable homologue, Im9, even in the presence of 0.4 M sodium sulphate. Previous studies using phi-value analysis have shown that the Im7 intermediate is misfolded, in that three of its four native helices are formed, but are docked in a non-native manner. Using knowledge of the structure of the intermediate of Im7, we have used rational design to stabilise an intermediate formed during the folding of Im9 by the introduction of specific stabilising interactions at positions known to stabilise the Im7 folding intermediate through non-native interactions. We show that the redesigned Im9 sequence folds with three-state kinetics at pH 7.0 and have used phi-value analysis to demonstrate that this species resembles the misfolded intermediate populated during Im7 folding. The redesigned Im9 sequence folds 20-fold faster than the wild-type protein under conditions in which folding is two-state. The data show that intermediate formation is an important feature of folding, even for small proteins such as Im9 for which these partially folded states do not become significantly populated. In addition, they show that the introduction of stabilising interactions can lead to rapid refolding, even when the contacts introduced are non-native.},

It is not clear whether this type of folding landscape results from insufficient evolutionary pressure to optimize folding efficiency, or arises from a conflict between functional and folding constraints. Here, using protein-engineering, ultra-rapid mixing and stopped-flow experiments combined with restrained molecular dynamics simulations, we characterize the transition state for the formation of the intermediate populated during the folding of the bacterial immunity protein, Im7, and the subsequent molecular steps leading to the native state. The results provide a comprehensive view of the folding process of this small protein. An analysis of the contributions of native and non-native interactions at different stages of folding reveals how the complexity of the folding landscape arises from concomitant evolutionary pressures for function and folding efficiency.},

abstract = {We have studied the thermodynamics of the interaction between the ribonuclease barnase and its natural polypeptide inhibitor barstar. The contribution of specific residues and interactions within the barnase-barstar interface to the enthalpy of binding has been examined using isothermal titration calorimetry and protein engineering. The enthalpy of association of the wild-type proteins is -18.9 (+/-0.1) kcal/mol at pH 8 and at 25 degrees C. The enthalpy of binding remains favourable for 31 different combinations of mutations in the interface. The effects on the binding enthalpy upon replacing a side-chain involved in the interaction of barnase and barstar are, however, always unfavourable and in most cases larger than the effects on the free energy of binding. Interaction enthalpies calculated by double mutant cycle analysis are in some cases much larger than the interaction free energies. The interaction enthalpies for complexes between different barnase mutants with amino acid substitutions of the general base residue glutamic acid 73 and a barstar variant (D39A) vary by as much as 8.3 kcal/mol while the coupling free energies differ only by 1 kcal/mol. The use of enthalpies for the analysis of structure-activity relationships appears to be complicated by enthalpy-entropy compensation of weak intermolecular interactions. These tend to cancel out in measurements of free energy, which is thus the preferred quantity for simple analysis of interactions.},

abstract = {Allosteric communication is a fundamental process that proteins use to propagate signals from one site to functionally important distal sites. Although allostery is usually associated with multimeric proteins and enzymes, "long-range" communication may be a fundamental property of proteins. In some cases, communication occurs with minimal structural change. PDZ (post-synaptic density-95/discs large/zonula occludens-1) domains are small, protein-protein binding modules that can use multiple surfaces for docking diverse molecules. Furthermore, these domains have long-range energetic couplings that link the ligand-binding site to distal regions of the structure. Here, we show that allosteric behavior in a representative member of the PDZ domain family may be directly detected using side-chain methyl dynamics measurements. The changes in side-chain dynamics parameters in the second PDZ domain from the human tyrosine phosphatase 1E (hPTP1E) were determined upon binding a peptide target. Long-range dynamic effects were detected that correspond to previously observed pair-wise energetic couplings. These results provide one of the first experimental examples for the potential role of ps-ns timescale dynamics in propagating long-range signals within a protein, and reinforce the idea that dynamic fluctuations in proteins contribute to allosteric signal transduction. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we have used mutagenesis and NMR relaxation methods to investigate the scope and nature of the communication networks found in the second post-synaptic density-95/discs large/zonula occludens-1 (PDZ) domain of the human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1E protein (hPTP1E) (PDZ2). It was found that most mutations do not have a significant energetic contribution to peptide ligand binding. Three mutants that showed significant changes in binding also displayed context-dependent dynamic effects. Both a mutation at a partially exposed site (H71Y) and a buried core position (I35V) had a limited response in side-chain 2H-based dynamics when compared to wild-type PDZ2. In contrast, a change at a second core position (I20F) that had previously been shown to be part of an energetic and dynamic network, resulted in extensive changes in side-chain dynamics. This response is reminiscent to that seen previously upon peptide ligand binding. These results shed light on the nature of the PDZ2 dynamic network and suggest that position 20 in PDZ2 acts as a "hub" that is energetically and dynamically critical for transmitting changes in dynamics throughout the PDZ domain. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Thrombin is the central protease in the cascade of blood coagulation proteases. The structure of thrombin consists of a double $\beta$-barrel core surrounded by connecting loops and helices. Compared to chymotrypsin, thrombin has more extended loops that are thought to have arisen from insertions in the serine protease that evolved to impart greater specificity. Previous experiments showed thermodynamic coupling between ligand binding at the active site and distal exosites. We present a combined approach of molecular dynamics (MD), accelerated molecular dynamics (AMD), and analysis of the residual local frustration of apo-thrombin and active-site-bound (PPACK-thrombin). Community analysis of the MD ensembles identified changes upon active site occupation in groups of residues linked through correlated motions and physical contacts. AMD simulations, calibrated on measured residual dipolar couplings, reveal that upon active site ligation, correlated loop motions are quenched, but new ones connecting the active site with distal sites where allosteric regulators bind emerge. Residual local frustration analysis reveals a striking correlation between frustrated contacts and regions undergoing slow time scale dynamics. The results elucidate a motional network that probably evolved through retention of frustrated contacts to provide facile conversion between ensembles of states.},

abstract = {Excitatory neurotransmission mediated by NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is fundamental to the physiology of the mammalian central nervous system. These receptors are heteromeric ion channels that for activation require binding of glycine and glutamate to the NR1 and NR2 subunits, respectively. NMDA receptor function is characterized by slow channel opening and deactivation, and the resulting influx of cations initiates signal transduction cascades that are crucial to higher functions including learning and memory. Here we report crystal structures of the ligand-binding core of NR2A with glutamate and that of the NR1-NR2A heterodimer with glutamate and glycine. The NR2A-glutamate complex defines the determinants of glutamate and NMDA recognition, and the NR1-NR2A heterodimer suggests a mechanism for ligand-induced ion channel opening. Analysis of the heterodimer interface, together with biochemical and electrophysiological experiments, confirms that the NR1-NR2A heterodimer is the functional unit in tetrameric NMDA receptors and that tyrosine 535 of NR1, located in the subunit interface, modulates the rate of ion channel deactivation.},

We were able to determine the potential of mean force in the transition region between a minor alpha-helical population and the major beta-hairpin population and identify a possible transition path between them along which the peptide retains a significant amount of secondary structure. This observation provides new insights into a possible mechanism of formation of beta-sheet secondary structures in proteins. We developed a novel Bayesian statistical uncertainty estimation method for any quantity derived from WHAM and used it to validate the calculated potential of mean force. The feasibility of estimating regions of the potential of mean force with unfavorable free energy at room temperature by T-WHAM analysis of replica exchange simulations was further tested on a system that can be solved analytically and presented some of the same challenges found in more complex chemical systems.},

abstract = {When a protein folds or unfolds, it has to pass through many half-folded microstates. Only a few of them can be seen experimentally. In a two-state transition proceeding with no accumulation of metastable intermediates [Fersht, A. R. (1995) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 5, 79-84], only the semifolded microstates corresponding to the transition state can be outlined; they influence the folding/unfolding kinetics. Our aim is to calculate them, provided the three-dimensional protein structure is given. The presented approach follows from the capillarity theory of protein folding and unfolding [Wolynes, P. G. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94, 6170-6175]. The approach is based on a search for free-energy saddle point(s) on a network of protein unfolding pathways. Under some approximations, this search is rapidly performed by dynamic programming and, despite its relative simplicity, gives a good correlation with experiment. The computed folding nuclei look like ensembles of those compact and closely packed parts of the three-dimensional native folds that contain a small number of disordered protruding loops. Their estimated free energy is consistent with the rapid (within seconds) folding and unfolding of small proteins at the point of thermodynamic equilibrium between the native fold and the coil.},

abstract = {Biological activity in proteins requires them to share the energy landscape for folding and global conformational motions, 2 key determinants of function. Although most structural studies to date have focused on fluctuations around a single structural basin, we directly observe the coexistence of 2 symmetrically opposed conformations for a mutant of the Rop-homodimer (Repressor of Primer) in single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurements. We find that mild denaturing conditions can affect the sensitive balance between the conformations, generating an equilibrium ensemble consisting of 2 equally occupied structural basins. Despite the need for large-scale conformational rearrangement, both native structures are dynamically and reversibly adopted for the same paired molecules without separation of the constituent monomers. Such an ability of some proteins or protein complexes to switch between conformations by thermal fluctuations and/or minor environmental changes could be central to their ability to control biological function.},

abstract = {We present a generic solvated coarse-grained protein model that can be used to characterize the driving forces behind protein folding. Each amino acid is coarse-grained with two beads, a backbone, and a side chain. Although the backbone beads are modeled as polar entities, side chains are hydrophobic, polar, or charged, thus allowing the exploration of how sequence patterning determines a protein fold. The change in orientation of the atoms of the coarse-grained unit is captured by the addition of two oppositely charged dummy particles inside the backbone coarse-grained bead. These two dummy charges represent a dipole that can fluctuate, thus introducing structural polarization into the coarse-grained model. Realistic $\alpha$/$\beta$ content is achieved de novo without any biases in the force field toward a particular secondary structure. The dipoles created by the dummy particles interact with each other and drive the protein models to fold into unique structures depending on the amino acid patterning and presence of capping residues. We have also characterized the role of dipole-dipole and dipole-charge interactions in shaping the secondary and supersecondary structure of proteins. Formation of helix bundles and $\beta$-strands are also discussed.},

We present a detailed structure-based kinetic model for the mechanism of action of F1-ATPase and demonstrate the role of different protein conformations for substrate binding during ATP synthesis and ATP hydrolysis. The model shows that the pathway for ATP hydrolysis is not simply the pathway for ATP synthesis in reverse.

Experimentally measured rates of spontaneous folding of single-domain globular proteins range from microseconds to hours: the difference (11 orders of magnitude) is akin to the difference between the life span of a mosquito and the age of the universe. Here, we show that physical theory with biological constraints outlines a "golden triangle" limiting the possible range of folding rates for single-domain globular proteins of various size and stability, and that the experimentally measured folding rates fall within this narrow triangle built without any adjustable parameters, filling it almost completely. In addition, the golden triangle predicts the maximal size of protein domains that fold under solely thermodynamic (rather than kinetic) control. It also predicts the maximal allowed size of the "foldable" protein domains, and the size of domains found in known protein structures is in a good agreement with this limit.},

@article{Garcia2000,
abstract = {The kinetics of water penetration and escape in cytochrome c (cyt c) is studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at various temperatures. Water molecules that penetrate the protein interior during the course of an MD simulation are identified by monitoring the number of water molecules in the first coordination shell (within 3.5 A) of each water molecule in the system. Water molecules in the interior of cyt c have 0-3 water molecules in their first hydration shell and this coordination number persists for extended periods of time. At T = 300 K we identify over 200 events in which water molecules penetrate the protein and reside inside for at least 5 picoseconds (ps) within a 1.5 nanoseconds (ns) time period. Twenty-seven (27) water molecules reside for at least 300 ps, 17 water molecules reside in the protein interior for times longer than 500 ps, and two interior water molecules do not escape; at T = 360 K one water molecule does not escape; at 430 K all water molecules exchange. Some of the internal water molecules show mean square displacements (MSD) of 1 A2 characteristic of structural waters. Others show MSD as large as 12 A2, suggesting that some of these water molecules occupy transient cavities and diffuse extensively within the protein. Motions of protein-bound water molecules are rotationally hindred, but show large librations. Analysis of the kinetics of water escape in terms of a survival time correlation function shows a power law behavior in time that can be interpreted in terms of a broad distribution of energy barriers, relative to kappa BT, for water exchange. At T = 300 K estimates of the roughness of the activation energy distribution is 4-10 kJ/mol (2-4 kappa BT). Activation enthalpies for water escape are 6-23 kJ/mol. The difference in activation entropies between fast exchanging (0.01 ns) and slow exchanging (0.1-1 ns) water molecules is -27 J/K/mol. Dunitz (Science 1997;264:670.) has estimated the maximum entropy loss of a water molecule due to binding to be 28 J/K/mol. Therefore, our results suggest that the entropy of interior water molecules is similar to entropy of bulk water.},

Max Cal is a method of deriving dynamical models based on maximizing the path entropy subject to dynamical constraints. We give three different cases. First, we show that if constraints (or data) are given in the form of singlet statistics (average occupation probabilities), then maximizing the caliber predicts a time-independent process that is modeled by identical, independently distributed random variables. Second, we show that if constraints are given in the form of sequential pairwise statistics, then maximizing the caliber dictates that the kinetic process will be Markovian with a uniform initial distribution. Third, if the initial distribution is known and is not uniform we show that the only process that maximizes the path entropy is still the Markov process. We give an example of how Max Cal can be used to discriminate between different dynamical models given data.},

abstract = {An algorithm is applied here to compute folding pathways of staphylococcal protein A, fragment B. Emphasis is on studies of the complete process, starting from an ensemble of fully denatured conformations and ending at the folded state. The stochastic difference equation algorithm is based on optimization of an action that makes it possible to use a large integration step. Motions with typical displacements that change rapidly on the size scale of the step are filtered out, providing numerically stable and approximate solutions. The present approach is unique in maintaining an atomically detailed picture while providing a systematic, controlled approximation to the classical equations of motion. Analysis of 130 trajectories suggests the following folding mechanism for protein A: At an early precollapse phase of the process, a few native hydrogen bonds form near the C terminus of the protein. The hydrogen bonds are formed mostly within the third helix. The next step is chain collapse that occurs in parallel to additional growth of secondary structure seeds. Therefore, the present study does not support a pure hydrophobic collapse, or substantial early formation of secondary structure. At the last step, native tertiary contacts are formed at the same time as the completion of the secondary structure elements. To a large extent, the process is parallel and not sequential. The early formation of the third helix of protein A, fragment B (in the calculation), is consistent with experimental data.},

The present model addresses a problem raised by Kaya and Chan that proteins fold more cooperatively than previous models predict. The present model correctly predicts the experimentally observed two-state cooperativities, DeltaH(van't Hoff)/DeltaH(cal) approximately 1, for helix-bundle proteins.

abstract = {Many processes in science and engineering develop multiscale temporal and spatial patterns, with complex underlying dynamics and time-dependent external forcings. Because of the importance in understanding and predicting these phenomena, extracting the salient modes of variability empirically from incomplete observations is a problem of wide contemporary interest. Here, we present a technique for analyzing high-dimensional, complex time series that exploits the geometrical relationships between the observed data points to recover features characteristic of strongly nonlinear dynamics (such as intermittency and rare events), which are not accessible to classical singular spectrum analysis. The method employs Laplacian eigenmaps, evaluated after suitable time-lagged embedding, to produce a reduced representation of the observed samples, where standard tools of matrix algebra can be used to perform truncated singular-value decomposition despite the nonlinear geometrical structure of the dataset. We illustrate the utility of the technique in capturing intermittent modes associated with the Kuroshio current in the North Pacific sector of a general circulation model and dimensional reduction of a low-order atmospheric model featuring chaotic intermittent regime transitions, where classical singular spectrum analysis is already known to fail dramatically.},

abstract = {PDZ domains represent a large family of protein-interaction modules associated with a variety of unrelated proteins with different functions. We report a complete characterization of the kinetic folding mechanism of a fluorescent variant of PDZ2 from PTP-BL, investigated under a variety of different experimental conditions. For this purpose, we engineered a fluorescent variant of this protein Y43W (called pseudo-wild-type, pWT43). The results suggest the presence of a high-energy intermediate in the folding of PDZ2, as revealed by a pronounced non-linear dependence of the unfolding rate constant on denaturant concentration. Such an intermediate may or may not be detectable depending on the experimental conditions, giving rise to apparent two-state folding under stabilizing conditions (e.g. in the presence of sodium sulfate). Interestingly, even under these conditions, three-state folding can be restored by selectively destabilizing the native-like rate-limiting barrier by one specific mutation (V44A). Finally, we show that data taken on pWT43 under different experimental conditions (e.g. different pH values from 2.1 to 8.0 or in the presence of a stabilizing salt) and also data on a site-directed conservative mutant can be rationalized in terms of a simple reaction scheme involving a single set of intermediates and transition states.},

abstract = {A unifying view has been recently proposed according to which the classical diffusion-collision and nucleation-condensation models may represent two extreme manifestations of an underlying common mechanism for the folding of small globular proteins. We report here the characterization of the folding process of the PDZ domain, a protein that recapitulates the three canonical steps involved in this unifying mechanism, namely: (i) the early formation of a weak nucleus that determines the native-like topology of a large portion of the structure, (ii) a global collapse of the entire polypeptide chain, and (iii) the consolidation of the remaining partially structured regions to achieve the native state conformation. These steps, which are clearly detectable in the PDZ domain investigated here, may be difficult to distinguish experimentally in other proteins, which would thus appear to follow one of the two limiting mechanisms. The analysis of the (un)folding kinetics for other three-state proteins (when available) appears consistent with the predictions ensuing from this unifying mechanism, thus providing a powerful validation of its general nature.},

The homeodomain superfamily of three-helical, single-domain proteins exhibits a spectrum of folding processes that spans the complete transition from concurrent secondary and tertiary structure formation (nucleation-condensation mechanism) to sequential secondary and tertiary formation (framework mechanism). The unifying factor in their mechanisms is that the transition state for (un)folding is expanded and very native-like, with the proportion and degree of formation of secondary and tertiary interactions varying. There is a transition, or slide, from the framework to nucleation-condensation mechanism with decreasing stability of the secondary structure. Thus, framework and nucleation-condensation are different manifestations of an underlying common mechanism.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions mediated by modular protein domains are critical for cell scaffolding, differentiation, signaling, and ultimately, evolution. Given the vast number of ligands competing for binding to a limited number of domain families, it is often puzzling how specificity can be achieved. Selectivity may be modulated by intradomain allostery, whereby a remote residue is energetically connected to the functional binding site via side chain or backbone interactions. Whereas several energetic pathways, which could mediate intradomain allostery, have been predicted in modular protein domains, there is a paucity of experimental data to validate their existence and roles. Here, we have identified such functional energetic networks in one of the most common protein-protein interaction modules, the PDZ domain. We used double mutant cycles involving site-directed mutagenesis of both the PDZ domain and the peptide ligand, in conjunction with kinetics to capture the fine energetic details of the networks involved in peptide recognition. We performed the analysis on two homologous PDZ-ligand complexes and found that the energetically coupled residues differ for these two complexes. This result demonstrates that amino acid sequence rather than topology dictates the allosteric pathways. Furthermore, our data support a mechanism whereby the whole domain and not only the binding pocket is optimized for a specific ligand. Such cross-talk between binding sites and remote residues may be used to fine tune target selectivity.},

We present structural and dynamical evidence for allosteric effects in a PDZ domain, PDZ2 from the tyrosine phosphatase PTP-BL, upon binding to a target peptide. The NMR structures of its free and peptide-bound states differ in the orientation of helix $\alpha$2 with respect to the remainder of the molecule, concomitant with a readjustment of the hydrophobic core. Using an ultrafast mixing instrument, we detected a deviation from simple bimolecular kinetics for the association with peptide that is consistent with a rate-limiting conformational change in the protein (kobs ∼7 × 103 s-1) and an induced-fit model. Furthermore, the binding kinetics of 15 mutants revealed that binding is regulated by long-range interactions, which can be correlated with the structural rearrangements resulting from peptide binding. The homologous protein PSD-95 PDZ3 did not display a similar ligand-induced conformational change. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This article situates the development of the university as a militarized knowledge factory within the broader context of what I call the biopolitics of militarization and its increasing influence and power within American society after the tragic events of September 11, 2001. Highlighting and critically engaging the specific ways in which the forces of militarization are shaping various aspects of university life, this article focuses on the growth of militarized knowledge and research, the increasing development of academic programs and schools that serve military personnel, and the ongoing production of military values and subject positions on US campuses. It also charts how the alliance between the university and the national security state has undermined the university as a site of criticism, dissent and critical dialogue.},

While the function in catalysis or binding of individual charges in the active site can often be identified, it is less clear how to assign function to charges beyond this region. Are they necessary for solubility? For reasons other than solubility? Can manipulating these charges change the properties of proteins? A combination of capillary electrophoresis (CE) and protein charge ladders makes it possible to study the roles of charged residues on the surface of proteins outside the active site. This method involves chemical modification of those residues to generate a large number of derivatives of the protein that differ in charge. CE separates those derivatives into groups with the same number of modified charged groups. By studying the influence of charge on the properties of proteins using charge ladders, it is possible to estimate the net charge and hydrodynamic radius and to infer the role of charged residues in ligand binding and protein folding.},

abstract = {Differential scanning calorimetry was used to measure the temperature dependence of the absolute heat capacity of the 35-residue subdomain of the villin headpiece, a protein that folds in 5 mus and is therefore assumed to have a small free-energy barrier separating folded and unfolded states. To obtain an estimate of the barrier height from the calorimetric data, two models, a variable-barrier model and an Ising-like model, were used to fit the heat capacity in excess of the folded state over the temperature range 15-125 degrees C. The variable-barrier model is based on an empirical mathematical form for the density of states, with four adjustable parameters and the enthalpy (H) as a reaction coordinate. The Ising-like model is based on the inter-residue contact map of the X-ray structure with exact enumeration of approximately 10(5) possible conformations, with two adjustable parameters in the partition function, and either the fraction of native contacts (Q) or the number of ordered residues (P) as reaction coordinates. The variable-barrier model provides an excellent fit to the data and yields a barrier height at the folding temperature ranging from 0.4 to 1.1 kcal mol(-1), while the Ising-like model provides a less good fit and yields barrier heights of 2.3 +/- 0.1 kcal mol(-1) and 2.1 +/- 0.1 kcal mol(-1) for the Q and P reaction coordinates, respectively. In both models, the barrier to folding increases with increasing temperature. Assuming a sufficiently large activation energy for diffusion on the free-energy surfaces, both models are consistent with the observation of a temperature-independent folding rate in previously published laser temperature-jump experiments. Analysis of this kinetic data, using an approximate form for the pre-exponential factor of Kramers theory and the 70 ns relaxation time for the fast phase that precedes the unfolding/refolding relaxation to determine the diffusion coefficient, results in a barrier height of 1.6 +/- 0.3 kcal mol-1 for an unspecified reaction coordinate. Although no independent test of the validity of the H, Q, or P reaction coordinates is given, the barrier-height estimates obtained with the three reaction coordinates are in quite good agreement with the value derived from a Kramers analysis of the kinetics that makes no assumptions about the reaction coordinate. However, the higher estimates obtained using Q or P appear more consistent with the finding of barrier-crossing kinetics of a villin mutant that folds in 700 ns, corresponding to a 1.3 kcal mol-1 reduction in the folding barrier relative to wild-type. All of the results suggest that the free-energy barrier to folding is sufficiently low that it should be possible to engineer this protein or find solution conditions that would eliminate the barrier to create the "downhill" folding scenario of Wolynes and Onuchic.},

A major factor is the presence in the protein of a segment that can form a tightly complementary interface with an identical segment, which permits the formation of a steric zipper-two self-complementary beta sheets that form the spine of an amyloid fibril. Another factor is sufficient conformational freedom of the self-complementary segment to interact with other molecules. Using RNase A as a model system, we validate our fibrillogenic predictions by the 3D profile method based on the crystal structure of NNQQNY and demonstrate that a specific residue order is required for fiber formation. Our genome-wide analysis revealed that self-complementary segments are found in almost all proteins, yet not all proteins form amyloids. The implication is that chaperoning effects have evolved to constrain self-complementary segments from interaction with each other.},

abstract = {Single-molecule spectroscopy can monitor transitions between two microscopic states when these transitions are associated with the emission of photons. A general formalism is developed for obtaining the statistics of such transitions from a microscopic model when the dynamics is described by master or rate equations or their continuum analog, multidimensional reaction-diffusion equations. The focus is on the distribution of the number of transitions during a fixed observation time, the distribution of times between transitions, and the corresponding correlation functions. It is shown how these quantities are related to each other and how they can be explicitly calculated in a straightforward way for both immobile and diffusing molecules. Our formalism reduces to renewal theory when the monitored transitions either go to or originate from a single state. The influence of dynamics slow compared with the time between monitored transitions is treated in a simple way, and the probability distributions are expressed in terms of Mandel-type formulas. The formalism is illustrated by a detailed analysis of the statistics of catalytic turnovers of enzymes. When the rates of conformational changes are slower than the catalytic rates which are in turn slower than the binding relaxation rate, (1) the mean number of turnovers is shown to have the classical Michaelis-Menten form, (2) the correlation function of the number of turnovers is a direct measure of the time scale of catalytic rate fluctuations, and (3) the distribution of the time between consecutive turnovers is determined by the steady-state distribution.},

abstract = {Conformational dynamics of a single molecule can be studied using Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) by recording a sequence of photons emitted by a donor and an acceptor dye attached to the molecule. We describe a simple and robust method to estimate the rates of transitions between different conformational states and the FRET efficiencies associated with these states. For a photon trajectory with measured interphoton times, the pattern of colors is decoded by maximizing the appropriate likelihood function. This approach can be used to analyze bursts of photons from diffusing molecules as well as photon trajectories generated by immobilized molecules. The procedure is illustrated using simulated photon trajectories corresponding to two-state and three-state molecules. The method works even when the photon colors appear to be scrambled because of high background noise, the photophysical properties of the conformers are similar, or the conformational and photon count rates are comparable. The consistency of the model with the data can be checked by recoloring the photon trajectories and comparing the predicted and observed FRET efficiency histograms.},

abstract = {We present the theory for the distribution of the number of donor and acceptor photons detected in a time bin and the corresponding energy-transfer efficiency distribution obtained from single-molecule Forster resonance energy-transfer measurements. Photon counts from both immobilized and freely diffusing molecules are considered. Our starting point is the joint distribution for the donor and acceptor photons for a system described by an arbitrary kinetic scheme. This is simplified by exploiting the time scale separation between fast fluorescent transitions and slow processes which include conformational dynamics, intersystem conversion to a dark state, and translational diffusion in and out of the laser spot. The fast fluorescent transitions result in a Poisson distribution of the number of photons which is then averaged over slow fluctuations of the local transfer efficiency and the total number of photons. The contribution of various processes to the distribution and the variance of the energy-transfer efficiency are analyzed.},

abstract = {Studies using low-resolution fiber diffraction, electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy on various amyloid fibrils indicate that the misfolded conformers must be modular, compact, and adopt a cross-beta structure. In an earlier study, we used electron crystallography to delineate molecular models of the N-terminally truncated, disease-causing isoform (PrP(Sc)) of the prion protein, designated PrP 27-30, which polymerizes into amyloid fibrils, but we were unable to choose between a trimeric or hexameric arrangement of right- or left-handed beta-helical models. From a study of 119 all-beta folds observed in globular proteins, we have now determined that, if PrP(Sc) follows a known protein fold, it adopts either a beta-sandwich or parallel beta-helical architecture. With increasing evidence arguing for a parallel beta-sheet organization in amyloids, we contend that the sequence of PrP is compatible with a parallel left-handed beta-helical fold. Left-handed beta-helices readily form trimers, providing a natural template for a trimeric model of PrP(Sc). This trimeric model accommodates the PrP sequence from residues 89-175 in a beta-helical conformation with the C terminus (residues 176-227), retaining the disulfide-linked alpha-helical conformation observed in the normal cellular isoform. In addition, the proposed model matches the structural constraints of the PrP 27-30 crystals, positioning residues 141-176 and the N-linked sugars appropriately. Our parallel left-handed beta-helical model provides a coherent framework that is consistent with many structural, biochemical, immunological, and propagation features of prions. Moreover, the parallel left-handed beta-helical model for PrP(Sc) may provide important clues to the structure of filaments found in some other neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) designate a class of proteins that are able to bind to and inhibit the growth of macromolecular ice. These proteins have been characterized from a variety of organisms. Recently, the structures of AFPs from the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) and the yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) have been determined by NMR and X-ray crystallography. Despite nonhomologous sequences, both proteins were shown to consist of beta-helices. We review the structures and dynamics data of these two insect AFPs to bring insight into the structure-function relationship and explore their beta-helical architecture. For the spruce budworm protein, the fold is a left-handed beta-helix with 15 residues per coil. The Tenebrio molitor protein consists of a right-handed beta-helix with 12 residues per coil. Mutagenesis and structural studies show that the insect AFPs present a highly rigid array of threonine residues and bound water molecules that can effectively mimic the ice lattice. Comparisons of the newly determined ryegrass and carrot AFP sequences have led to models suggesting that they might also consist of beta-helices, and indicate that the beta-helix might be used as an AFP structural motif in nonfish organisms.},

abstract = {The minimum motor domain of kinesin-1 is a single head. Recent evidence suggests that such minimal motor domains generate force by a biased binding mechanism, in which they preferentially select binding sites on the microtubule that lie ahead in the progress direction of the motor. A specific molecular mechanism for biased binding has, however, so far been lacking. Here we use atomistic Brownian dynamics simulations combined with experimental mutagenesis to show that incoming kinesin heads undergo electrostatically guided diffusion-to-capture by microtubules, and that this produces directionally biased binding. Kinesin-1 heads are initially rotated by the electrostatic field so that their tubulin-binding sites face inwards, and then steered towards a plus-endwards binding site. In tethered kinesin dimers, this bias is amplified. A 3-residue sequence (RAK) in kinesin helix alpha-6 is predicted to be important for electrostatic guidance. Real-world mutagenesis of this sequence powerfully influences kinesin-driven microtubule sliding, with one mutant producing a 5-fold acceleration over wild type. We conclude that electrostatic interactions play an important role in the kinesin stepping mechanism, by biasing the diffusional association of kinesin with microtubules.},

Here we report that this picture does not hold generally: a hydrogen bond network involving two beta-turns and an adjacent hydrophobic cluster appear to be formed in the folding transition state of the src SH3 domain, while the remainder of the polypeptide chain is largely unstructured. Comparison with data on other small proteins suggests that this structural polarization is a consequence of the topology of the SH3 domain fold.

In aging cells and in cells from certain individuals with genetic diseases, the load may overwhelm the PQC capacity, resulting in accumulation of misfolded proteins. Dependent on the properties of the protein and the efficiency of the PQC systems, the accumulated protein may be degraded or assembled into toxic oligomers and aggregates. To illustrate this concept, we discuss a number of very different protein misfolding diseases including phenylketonuria, Parkinson's disease, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus, and short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Despite the differences, an emerging paradigm suggests that the cellular effects of protein misfolding provide a common framework that may contribute to the elucidation of the cell pathology and guide intervention and treatment strategies of many genetic and age-dependent diseases.},

However, the recent explosion of sequence and structure information accompanied by the development of powerful computational methods led to the accumulation of examples of homologous proteins with globally distinct structures. Significant sequence conservation, local structural resemblance, and functional similarity strongly indicate evolutionary relationships between these proteins despite pronounced structural differences at the fold level. Several mechanisms such as insertions/deletions/substitutions, circular permutations, and rearrangements in beta-sheet topologies account for the majority of detected structural irregularities. The existence of evolutionarily related proteins that possess different folds brings new challenges to the homology modeling techniques and the structure classification strategies and offers new opportunities for protein design in experimental studies.},

The "chemical role" of the protein cavity in the control of the photoisomerization step has been elucidated. Isomerization is facilitated due to preferential electrostatic stabilization of the chromophore's excited state by the guanidium group of Arg52, located just above the negatively charged chromophore ring. In vacuo isomerization does not occur. Isomerization of the double bond is enhanced relative to isomerization of a single bond due to the steric interactions between the phenyl ring of the chromophore and the side chains of Arg52 and Phe62. In the isomerized configuration (ground-state cis), a proton transfer from Glu46 to the chromophore is far more probable than in the initial configuration (ground-state trans). It is this proton transfer that initiates the conformational changes within the protein, which are believed to lead to signaling.},

Even though the end points of such conformational changes are known for many proteins, the characteristics of the paths connecting these states remain largely unexplored. Rate-equilibrium linear free-energy relationships (LFERs) provide information about such pathways by relating changes in the free energy of the transition state to those of the ground states upon systematic perturbation of the system. Here we present an LFER analysis of the gating reaction pathway of the muscle acetylcholine receptor. We studied the closed <==> open conformational change at the single-molecule level following perturbation by series of single-site mutations, agonists and membrane voltages. This method provided a snapshot of several regions of the receptor at the transition state in terms of their approximate positions along the reaction coordinate, on a scale from 0 (closed-like) to 1 (open-like). The resulting map reveals a spatial gradient of positional values, which suggests that the conformational change proceeds in a wave-like manner, with the low-to-high affinity change at the transmitter-binding sites preceding the complete opening of the pore.},

Although ligand binding is not required for the channel to open, the binding of agonists (for example, acetylcholine) increases the closed right harpoon over left harpoon open equilibrium constant because the ion-impermeable --> ion-permeable transition of the ion pathway is accompanied by a low-affinity --> high-affinity change at the agonist-binding sites. The fact that the gating conformational change of muscle AChRs can be kinetically modeled as a two-state reaction has paved the way to the experimental characterization of the corresponding transition state, which represents a snapshot of the continuous sequence of molecular events separating the closed and open states. Previous studies of fully (di) liganded AChRs, combining single-channel kinetic measurements, site-directed mutagenesis, and data analysis in the framework of the linear free-energy relationships of physical organic chemistry, have suggested a transition-state structure that is consistent with channel opening being an asynchronous conformational change that starts at the extracellular agonist-binding sites and propagates toward the intracellular end of the pore. In this paper, I characterize the gating transition state of unliganded AChRs, and report a remarkable difference: unlike that of diliganded gating, the unliganded transition state is not a hybrid of the closed- and open-state structures but, rather, is almost indistinguishable from the open state itself. This displacement of the transition state along the reaction coordinate obscures the mechanism underlying the unliganded closed right harpoon over left harpoon open reaction but brings to light the malleable nature of free-energy landscapes of ion-channel gating.},

abstract = {Oceans not only cover the major part of the earth's surface but also reach into depths exceeding the height of the Mt Everest. They are populated down to the deepest levels (approximately 11,800 m), which means that a significant proportion of the global biosphere is exposed to pressures of up to 120 MPa. Although this fact has been known for more than a century, the ecology of the 'abyss' is still in its infancy. Only recently, barophilic adaptation, i.e. the requirement of elevated pressure for viability, has been firmly established. In non-adapted organisms, increased pressure leads to morphological anomalies or growth inhibition, and ultimately to cell death. The detailed molecular mechanism of the underlying 'metabolic dislocation' is unresolved. Effects of pressure as a variable in microbiology, biochemistry and biotechnology allow the structure/function relationship of proteins conjugates to be analyzed. In this context, stabilization by cofactors or accessory proteins has been observed. High-pressure equipment available today allows the comprehensive characterization of the behaviour of proteins under pressure. Single-chain proteins undergo pressure-induced denaturation in the 100-MPa range, which, in the case of oligomeric proteins or protein assemblies, is preceded by dissociation at lower pressure. The effects may be ascribed to the positive reaction volumes connected with the formation of hydrophobic and ionic interactions. In addition, the possibility of conformational effects exerted by moderate, non-denaturing pressures, and related to the intrinsic compressibility of proteins, is discussed. Crystallization may serve as a model reaction of protein self-organization. Kinetic aspects of its pressure-induced inhibition can be described by a model based on the Oosawa theory of molecular association. Barosensitivity is known to be correlated with the pressure-induced inhibition of protein biosynthesis. Attempts to track down the ultimate cause in the dissociation of ribosomes have revealed remarkable stabilization of functional complexes under pseudo-physiological conditions, with the post-translational complex as the most pressure-sensitive species. Apart from the key issue of barosensitivity and barophilic adaptation, high-pressure biochemistry may provide means to develop new approaches to nonthermic industrial processes, especially in the field of food technology.},

This is especially true now as the molecular level and the systems level descriptions begin to connect, and multi-scale approaches are being developed to solve cutting edge problems in biology. In some cases, the concepts and tools got their start in non-biological fields, and migrated over, such as the idea of glassy landscapes, fluorescence spectroscopy, or master equation approaches. In other cases, the tools were specifically developed with biological physics applications in mind, such as modeling of single molecule trajectories or super-resolution laser techniques. In this introduction to the special topic section on chemical physics of biological systems, we consider a wide range of contributions, all the way from the molecular level, to molecular assemblies, chemical physics of the cell, and finally systems-level approaches, based on the contributions to this special issue. Chemical physicists can look forward to an exciting future where computational tools, analytical models, and new instrumentation will push the boundaries of biological inquiry.},

abstract = {We present a detailed structural characterization of the intermediate state populated during the folding and unfolding of the bacterial immunity protein Im7. We achieve this result by incorporating a variety of experimental data available for this species in molecular dynamics simulations. First, we define the structure of the exchange-competent intermediate state of Im7 by using equilibrium hydrogen-exchange protection factors. Second, we use this ensemble to predict Phi-values and compare the results with the experimentally determined Phi-values of the kinetic refolding intermediate. Third, we predict chemical-shift measurements and compare them with the measured chemical shifts of a mutational variant of Im7 for which the kinetic folding intermediate is the most stable state populated at equilibrium. Remarkably, we found that the properties of the latter two species are predicted with high accuracy from the exchange-competent intermediate that we determined, suggesting that these three states are characterized by a similar architecture in which helices I, II, and IV are aligned in a native-like, but reorganized, manner. Furthermore, the structural ensemble that we obtained enabled us to rationalize the results of tryptophan fluorescence experiments in the WT protein and a series of mutational variants. The results show that the integration of diverse sets of experimental data at relatively low structural resolution is a powerful approach that can provide insights into the structural organization of this conformationally heterogeneous three-helix intermediate with unprecedented detail and highlight the importance of both native and non-native interactions in stabilizing its structure.},

abstract = {Putative transition-state ensemble (TSE) conformations of src SH3 were identified by monitoring the deviation from the experimental phi values along molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of unfolding. Sixty MD trajectories (for a total of about 7 micros) were then started from the putative TSE. About one-half of the 60 runs reached the folded state while unfolding was observed in the remaining half of the runs. This result validates phi-value analysis as an approach to obtain structural information on the transition state. It also demonstrates that an atomic resolution description of the TSE can be extracted from MD simulations. All conformations in the TSE have the central three-stranded beta-sheet formed in agreement with experimental data. An elongation of strand beta 2 as well as non-native side-chain interactions between the diverging turn and the distal hairpin are observed. The simulation results indicate that the tight packing of the side chains between the diverging turn and the distal hairpin is a necessary condition for rapid folding. Contacts between residues in the most structured element of the TSE, the central beta-sheet, are kinetically more important than those between the N- and C-terminal strands.},

FOLDEF uses a full atomic description of the structure of the proteins. The different energy terms taken into account in FOLDEF have been weighted using empirical data obtained from protein engineering experiments. First, we considered a training database of 339 mutants in nine different proteins and optimised the set of parameters and weighting factors that best accounted for the changes in stability of the mutants. The predictive power of the method was then tested using a blind test mutant database of 667 mutants, as well as a database of 82 protein-protein complex mutants. The global correlation obtained for 95 \% of the entire mutant database (1030 mutants) is 0.83 with a standard deviation of 0.81 kcal mol(-1) and a slope of 0.76. The present energy function uses a minimum of computational resources and can therefore easily be used in protein design algorithms, and in the field of protein structure and folding pathways prediction where one requires a fast and accurate energy function.

abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Since folding in vivo often requires the action of chaperone molecules and ATP hydrolysis, we must ask whether folding in a system maintained away from equilibrium can avoid the Levinthal paradox in other ways. We describe a model of the action of chaperone molecules in protein folding in vivo on the basis of a repetitive cycle of binding and unbinding, allowing the possibility of kinetic proofreading. We also study models in which chaperone binding is locally biased, depending on the similarity of the conformation to the native one. We show that while kinetic proofreading can modestly facilitate folding, it is insufficient by itself to overcome the Levinthal paradox. On the other hand, such kinetic proofreading with biasing can provide the nonequilibrium analog of a folding funnel and greatly enhance folding yields and speed up folding.},

abstract = {Allostery involves coupling of conformational changes between two widely separated binding sites. The common view holds that allosteric proteins are symmetric oligomers, with each subunit existing in "at least" two conformational states with a different affinity for ligands. Recent observations such as the allosteric behavior of myoglobin, a classical example of a nonallosteric protein, call into question the existing allosteric dogma. Here we argue that all (nonfibrous) proteins are potentially allosteric. Allostery is a consequence of re-distributions of protein conformational ensembles. In a nonallosteric protein, the binding site shape may not show a concerted second-site change and enzyme kinetics may not reflect an allosteric transition. Nevertheless, appropriate ligands, point mutations, or external conditions may facilitate a population shift, leading a presumably nonallosteric protein to behave allosterically. In principle, practically any potential drug binding to the protein surface can alter the conformational redistribution. The question is its effectiveness in the redistribution of the ensemble, affecting the protein binding sites and its function. Here, we review experimental observations validating this view of protein allostery.},

Since the first volume in 1989 and the second in 1993, many exciting developments have occurred in the development of simulation techniques and their application to key biological problems such as protein folding, protein structure prediction and structure-based design, and in how, by combining experimental and theoretical approaches, very large biological systems can be studied at the molecular level. This series attempts to capture that progress. Volume 3 includes contributions that highlight developments in methodology which enable longer and more realistic simulations (e.g. multiple time steps and variable reduction techniques), a study of force fields for proteins and new force field development, a novel approach to the description of molecular shape and the use of molecular shape descriptors, the study of condensed phase chemical reactions, the use of electrostatic techniques in the study of protonation, equilibria and flexible docking studies, structure refinement using experimental data (X-ray, NMR, neutron, infrared) and theoretical methods (solvation models, normal mode analysis, MD simulations, MC lattice dynamics, and knowledge-based potentials). There are several chapters that show progress in the development of methodologies for the study of folding processes, binding affinities, and the prediction of ligand-protein complexes. The chapters, contributed by experienced researchers, many of whom are leaders in their field of study, are organised to cover developments in: simulation methodology the treatment of electrostatics protein structure refinement the combined experimental and theoretical approaches to the study of very large biological systems applications and methodology involved in the study of protein folding applications and methodology associated with structure-based design.},

abstract = {We measure the stability and folding rate of a mutant of the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) inside bone tissue cells as a function of temperature from 38 to 48 °C. To facilitate measurement in individual living cells, we developed a rapid laser temperature stepping method capable of measuring complete thermal melts and kinetic traces in about two min. We find that this method yields improved thermal melts compared to heating a sample chamber or microscope stage. By comparing results for six cells with in vitro data, we show that the protein is stabilized by about 6 kJ/mole in the cytoplasm, but the temperature dependence of folding kinetics is similar to in vitro. The main difference is a slightly steeper temperature dependence of the folding rate in some cells that can be rationalized in terms of temperature-dependent crowding, local viscosity, or hydrophobicity. The observed rate coefficients can be fitted within measurement uncertainty by an effective two-state model, even though PGK folds by a multistate mechanism. We validate the effective two-state model with a three-state free energy landscape of PGK to illustrate that the effective fitting parameters can represent a more complex underlying free energy landscape.},

abstract = {The multidimensional free energy surface for a small fast folding helical protein is explored based on first-principle calculations. The model represents the 46-residue segment from fragment B of staphylococcal protein A. The relationship between collapse and tertiary structure formation, and the order of collapse and secondary structure formation, are investigated. We find that the initial collapse process gives rise to a transition state with about 30\% of the native tertiary structure and 50-70\% of the native helix content. We also observe two distinct distributions of native helix in this collapsed state (Rg approximately 12 A), one with about 20\% of the native helical hydrogen bonds, the other with near 70\%. The former corresponds to a local minimum. The barrier from this metastable state to the native state is about 2 kBT. In the latter case, folding is essentially a downhill process involving topological assembly. In addition, the order of formation of secondary structure among the three helices is examined. We observe cooperative formation of the secondary structure in helix I and helix II. Secondary structure in helix III starts to form following the formation of certain secondary structure in both helix I and helix II. Comparisons of our results with those from theory and experiment are made.},

abstract = {Folding of the lattice model of proteins is studied using Monte Carlo simulation. The amino acid sequence is designed to have a pronounced energy minimum for a given target (native) conformation. Our simulations reveal two possible scenarios. When the overall attraction between residues dominates, we find that folding to the native conformation is preceded by a rapid collapse into a burst intermediate which is a compact but structureless globule. Then, after a much longer time, an all-or-none transition from the globule to the native conformation occurs. In contrast, when the overall attraction is not strong, we do not observe a burst collapse stage. Instead, we find an all-or-none transition directly from the coil to the native conformation. Both scenarios yield comparable rates of folding. On the basis of these findings we discuss the role of intermediates in thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding.},

abstract = {Coarse-graining a molecular model is the process of integrating over degrees of freedom to obtain a reduced representation. This process typically involves two separate but related steps, selection of the coordinates comprising the reduced system and modeling their interactions. Both the coordinate selection and the modeling procedure present challenges. Here, we focus on the former. Typically, one seeks to integrate over the fast degrees of freedom and retain the slow degrees of freedom. Failure to separate timescales results in memory. With this motivation, we introduce a heuristic measure of memory and show that it can be used to compare competing coordinate selections for a given modeling procedure. We numerically explore the utility of this heuristic for three systems of increasing complexity. The first example is a four-particle linear model, which is exactly solvable. The second example is a sixteen-particle nonlinear model; this system has interactions that are characteristic of molecular force fields but is still sufficiently simple to permit exhaustive numerical treatment. The third example is an atomic-resolution representation of a protein, the class of models most often treated by relevant coarse-graining approaches; we specifically study an actin monomer. In all three cases, we find that the heuristic suggests coordinate selections that are physically intuitive and reflect molecular structure. The memory heuristic can thus serve as an objective codification of expert knowledge and a guide to sites within a model that requires further attention.},

abstract = {Folding of the ribosomal protein S6 is a malleable process controlled by two competing, and partly overlapping, folding nuclei. Together, these nuclei extend over most of the S6 structure, except the edge strand $\beta$2, which is consistently missing in the folding transition states; despite being part of the S6 four-stranded sheet, $\beta$2 seems not to be part of the cooperative unit of the protein. The question is then whether $\beta$2 can be removed from the S6 structure without compromising folding cooperativity or native state integrity. To investigate this, we constructed a truncated variant of S6 lacking $\beta$2, reducing the size of the protein from 96 to 76 residues (S6($\Delta$$\beta$2)). The new S6 variant expresses well in Escherichia coli and has a well dispersed heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectrum and a perfectly wild-type-like crystal structure, but with a smaller three-stranded $\beta$-sheet. Moreover, S6($\Delta$$\beta$2) displays an archetypical v-shaped chevron plot with decreased slope of the unfolding limb, as expected from a protein with maintained folding cooperativity and reduced size. The results support the notion that foldons, as defined by the structural distribution of the folding nuclei, represent a property-based level of hierarchy in the build-up of larger protein structures and suggest that the role of $\beta$2 in S6 is mainly in intermolecular binding, consistent with the position of this strand in the ribosomal assembly.},

abstract = {An increasing number of protein structures are found to encompass multiple folding nuclei, allowing their structures to be formed by several competing pathways. A typical example is the ribosomal protein S6, which comprises two folding nuclei (sigma1 and sigma2) defining two competing pathways in the folding energy landscape: sigma1 --> sigma2 and sigma2 --> sigma1. The balance between the two pathways, and thus the order of folding events, is easily controlled by circular permutation. In this study, we make use of this ability to manipulate the folding pathway to demonstrate that the dynamic motions of the S6 structure are independent of how the protein folds. The HD-exchange protection factors remain the same upon complete reversal of the folding order. The phenomenon arises because the HD-exchange motions and the high-energy excitations controlling the folding pathway occur at separated free-energy levels: the Boltzmann distribution of unproductive unfolding attempts samples all unfolding channels in parallel, even those that end up in excessively high barriers. Accordingly, the findings provide a simple rationale for how to interpret native-state dynamics without the need to invoke fluctuations off the normal unfolding reaction coordinate.},

The latter, dynamic property is related to structural cooperativity and is controlled by the folding-energy landscape. Here we demonstrate that the structural cooperativity of the ribosomal protein S6 is optimized by geometric overlap of two competing folding nuclei: they both include the central beta-strand 1. In this way, folding of one nucleus catalyzes the formation of the other, contributing to make the folding transition more concerted overall. The experimental evidence is provided by an extended set of circular permutations of S6 that allows quantitative analysis of pathway plasticity at the level of individual side chains. Because similar overlap between competing nuclei also has been discerned in other proteins, we hypothesize that the coupling of several small nuclei into extended "supernuclei" represents a general principle for propagating folding cooperativity across large structural distances.},

abstract = {TNfn3, the third fibronectin type III domain of human tenascin, is an immunoglobulin-like protein that is a good model for experimental and theoretical analyses of Greek key folding. The third fibronectin type III domain of human tenascin folds and unfolds in a two-state fashion over a range of temperature and pH values, and in the presence of stabilising salts. Here, we present a high resolution protein engineering analysis of the single rate determining transition state. The 48 mutations report on the contribution of side-chains at 32 sites in the core and loop regions. Three areas in the protein exhibit high Phi-values, indicating that they are partially structured in the transition state. First, a common-core ring of four positions in the central strands B, C, E and F, that are in close contact, form a nucleus of tertiary interactions. The two other regions that appear well-formed are the C' region and the E-F loop. The Phi-values gradually decrease away from these regions such that the very ends of the two terminal strands A and G, have Phi-values of zero. We propose a model for the folding of immunoglobulin-like proteins in which the common-core "ring" forms the nucleus for folding, whilst the C' and E-F regions are constrained by topology to pack early. Folding characteristics of a group of structurally related proteins appear to support this model.},

Here, we address this by analysing the three-dimensional structures of multidomain proteins that have been characterized experimentally and observe that where the interface is small and loosely packed, or unstructured, the folding of the domains is independent. Furthermore, recent studies indicate that multidomain proteins have evolved mechanisms to minimize the problems of interdomain misfolding.},

abstract = {Many enzymes mold their structures to enclose substrates in their active sites such that conformational remodeling may be required during each catalytic cycle. In adenylate kinase (AK), this involves a large-amplitude rearrangement of the enzyme's lid domain. Using our method of high-resolution single-molecule FRET, we directly followed AK's domain movements on its catalytic time scale. To quantitatively measure the enzyme's entire conformational distribution, we have applied maximum entropy-based methods to remove photon-counting noise from single-molecule data. This analysis shows unambiguously that AK is capable of dynamically sampling two distinct states, which correlate well with those observed by x-ray crystallography. Unexpectedly, the equilibrium favors the closed, active-site-forming configurations even in the absence of substrates. Our experiments further showed that interaction with substrates, rather than locking the enzyme into a compact state, restricts the spatial extent of conformational fluctuations and shifts the enzyme's conformational equilibrium toward the closed form by increasing the closing rate of the lid. Integrating these microscopic dynamics into macroscopic kinetics allows us to model lid opening-coupled product release as the enzyme's rate-limiting step.},

abstract = {A mechanical view provides an attractive alternative for predicting the behavior of complex systems since it circumvents the resource-intensive requirements of atomistic models; however, it remains extremely challenging to characterize the mechanical responses of a system at the molecular level. Here, the structural distribution is proposed to be an effective means to extracting the molecular mechanical properties. End-to-end distance distributions for a series of short poly-l-proline peptides with the sequence P 
                        nCG 
                        3K-biotin (n = 8, 12, 15 and 24) were used to experimentally illustrate this new approach. High-resolution single-molecule F??rster-type resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments were carried out and the conformation-resolving power was characterized and discussed in the context of the conventional constant-time binning procedure for FRET data analysis. It was shown that the commonly adopted theoretical polymer models - including the worm-like chain, the freely jointed chain, and the self-avoiding chain - could not be distinguished by the averaged end-to-end distances, but could be ruled out using the molecular details gained by conformational distribution analysis because similar polymers of different sizes could respond to external forces differently. Specifically, by fitting the molecular conformational distribution to a semi-flexible polymer model, the effective persistence lengths for the series of short poly-l-proline peptides were found to be size-dependent with values of ???190 , ???67 , ???51 , and ???76 for n = 8, 12, 15, and 24, respectively. A comprehensive computational modeling was carried out to gain further insights for this surprising discovery. It was found that P 
                        8 exists as the extended all-trans isomaer whereas P 
                        12 and P 
                        15 predominantly contained one proline residue in the cis conformation. P 
                        24 exists as a mixture of one-cis (75\%) and two-cis (25\%) isomers where each isomer contributes to an experimentally resolvable conformational mode. This work demonstrates the resolving power of the distribution-based approach, and the capacity of integrating high-resolution single-molecule FRET experiments with molecular modeling to reveal detailed structural information about the conformation of molecules on the length scales relevant to the study of biological molecules. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The molecular biology underlying protein aggregation and neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease is not yet completely understood, but small soluble nonamyloid aggregates of the amyloid $\beta$-protein (A$\beta$) have been shown to play a fundamental neurotoxic role. The composition and biological action of such aggregates, known as oligomers and protofibrils, are therefore areas of intense study. However, research is complicated by the multitude of different interconverting aggregates that A$\beta$ can form in vitro and in vivo, and by the inhomogeneity and instability of in vitro preparations. Here we review recent studies in which protein engineering, and in particular disulfide engineering, has been applied to stabilize different A$\beta$ aggregates. For example, several techniques now exist to obtain stable and neurotoxic protofibrillar forms of A$\beta$, and engineered A$\beta$ dimers, or larger aggregates formed by these, have been shown to specifically induce neuronal damage in a way that mimics Alzheimer's disease pathology. Disulfide engineering has also revealed structural properties of neurotoxic aggregates, for instance that A$\beta$ in protofibrils and globular oligomers adopts a $\beta$-hairpin conformation that is similar to, but topologically distinct from, the conformation of A$\beta$ in mature amyloid fibrils. Protein engineering is therefore a workable strategy to address many of the outstanding questions relating to the structure, interconversion and biological effects of oligomers and protofibrils of A$\beta$.},

We have observed qualitatively different behavior in these two limits. In the Go limit, we see apparently barrier-less folding. As we increase the roughness of the model energy landscape, we can observe the emergence of the characteristic activated temperature dependence previously seen in lattice studies and analytical theories. We are also able to study the dependence of the folding kinetics on local interactions such as hydrogen bonds, and we discuss the implications of these results for the formation of secondary structure at intermediate stages of the folding reaction.},

The degree to which a model energy function for protein structure prediction can avoid the multiple minima problem and reliably yield at least low-resolution predictions is also dependent on the topography of the energy landscape. We show that the degree of funneling can be quantitatively expressed in terms of a few averaged properties of the landscape. This allows us to optimize simplified energy functions for protein structure prediction even in the absence of homology information. Here we outline the optimization procedure in the context of associative memory energy functions originally introduced for tertiary structure recognition and demonstrate that even partially funneled landscapes lead to qualitatively correct, low-resolution predictions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein volumes change very little on folding at low pressure, but at high pressure the unfolded state is more compact. So far, the molecular origins of this behaviour have not been explained: it is the opposite of that expected from the model of the hydrophobic effect based on the transfer of non-polar solutes from water to organic solvent.

RESULTS: We redetermined the mean volumes occupied by residues in the interior of proteins. The new residue volumes are smaller than those given by previous calculations which were based on much more limited data. They show that the packing density in protein interiors is exceptionally high. Comparison of the volumes that residues occupy in proteins with those they occupy in solution shows that aliphatic groups have smaller volumes in protein interiors than in solution, while peptide and charged groups have larger volumes. The cancellation of these volume changes is the reason that the net change on folding is very small.

CONCLUSIONS: The exceptionally high density of the protein interior shown here implies that packing forces play a more important role in protein stability than has been believed hitherto.},

The design of this peptide-amphiphile allows the nanofibers to be reversibly cross-linked to enhance or decrease their structural integrity. After cross-linking, the fibers are able to direct mineralization of hydroxyapatite to form a composite material in which the crystallographic c axes of hydroxyapatite are aligned with the long axes of the fibers. This alignment is the same as that observed between collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite crystals in bone.},

One subsystem is used to extract work from a heat bath while being affected by the second subsystem. We show that the latter allows for a transparent and thermodynamically consistent interpretation of a Maxwell's demon. Moreover, we obtain an integral fluctuation theorem involving the transfer entropy from one subsystem to the other. Comparing three different inequalities, we show that the entropy decrease of the first subsystem provides a tighter bound on the rate of extracted work than both the rate of transfer entropy from this subsystem to the demon and the heat dissipated through the dynamics of the demon. The latter two rates cannot be ordered by an inequality as shown with the illustrative example of a four state system.},

abstract = {Experiments demonstrate that Mg(2+) is crucial for structure and function of RNA systems, yet the detailed molecular mechanism of Mg(2+) action on RNA is not well understood. We investigate the interplay between RNA and Mg(2+) at atomic resolution through ten 2-$\mu$s explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the SAM-I riboswitch with varying ion concentrations. The structure, including three stemloops, is very stable on this time scale. Simulations reveal that outer-sphere coordinated Mg(2+) ions fluctuate on the same time scale as the RNA, and that their dynamics couple. Locally, Mg(2+) association affects RNA conformation through tertiary bridging interactions; globally, increasing Mg(2+) concentration slows RNA fluctuations. Outer-sphere Mg(2+) ions responsible for these effects account for 80\% of Mg(2+) in our simulations. These ions are transiently bound to the RNA, maintaining interactions, but shuttled from site to site. Outer-sphere Mg(2+) are separated from the RNA by a single hydration shell, occupying a thin layer 3-5 \AA from the RNA. Distribution functions reveal that outer-sphere Mg(2+) are positioned by electronegative atoms, hydration layers, and a preference for the major groove. Diffusion analysis suggests transient outer-sphere Mg(2+) dynamics are glassy. Since outer-sphere Mg(2+) ions account for most of the Mg(2+) in our simulations, these ions may change the paradigm of Mg(2+)-RNA interactions. Rather than a few inner-sphere ions anchoring the RNA structure surrounded by a continuum of diffuse ions, we observe a layer of outer-sphere coordinated Mg(2+) that is transiently bound but strongly coupled to the RNA.},

We applied this methodology to the synthetic $\beta$-hairpin, trpzip2, and one of its sequence variants, W2W9. Each simulation consisted of over 8 $\mu$s of aggregated virtual time. Several measures of folding behavior showed good convergence, allowing comparison with experimental equilibrium properties. Our simulations suggest that the intramolecular interactions of tryptophan side chains are responsible for much of the stability of the native fold. We conclude that the ff99 force field combined with ff96 $\phi$ and $\psi$ dihedral energies and an implicit solvent can reproduce plausible folding behavior in both trpzip2 and W2W9.},

abstract = {The left-handed $\beta$-helix (LHBH) is an intriguing, rare structural pattern in polypeptides that has been implicated in the formation of amyloid aggregates. We used accurate all-atom replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations to study the relative stability of diverse sequences in the LHBH conformation. Ensemble-average coordinates from REMD served as a scoring criterion to identify sequences and threadings optimally suited to the LHBH, as in a fold recognition paradigm. We examined the repeatability of our REMD simulations, finding that single simulations can be reliable to a quantifiable extent. We find expected behavior for the positive and negative control cases of a native LHBH and intrinsically disordered sequences, respectively. Polyglutamine and a designed hexapeptide repeat show remarkable affinity for the LHBH motif. A structural model for misfolded murine prion protein was also considered, and showed intermediate stability under the given conditions. Our technique is found to be an effective probe of LHBH stability, and promises to be scalable to broader studies of this and potentially other novel or rare motifs. The superstable character of the designed hexapeptide repeat suggests theoretical and experimental follow-ups.},

Here, in a designed system, we examine the mutational requirements for transitioning between folds and functions. We show that switching between monomeric 3?? and 4??+?? folds can occur in multiple ways with successive single amino acid changes at diverse residue positions, raising the likelihood that such transitions occur in the evolution of new folds. Even mutations on the periphery of the core can tip the balance between alternatively folded states. Ligand-binding studies illustrate that a new immunoglobulin G-binding function can be gained well before the relevant 4??+?? fold is appreciably populated in the unbound protein. The results provide new insights into the evolution of fold and function. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {How protein sequence codes for 3D structure remains a fundamental question in biology. One approach to understanding the folding code is to design a pair of proteins with maximal sequence identity but retaining different folds. Therefore, the nonidentities must be responsible for determining which fold topology prevails and constitute a fold-specific folding code. We recently designed two proteins, G(A)88 and G(B)88, with 88\% sequence identity but different folds and functions [Alexander et al. (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104:11963-11968]. Here, we describe the detailed 3D structures of these proteins determined in solution by NMR spectroscopy. Despite a large number of mutations taking the sequence identity level from 16 to 88\%, G(A)88 and G(B)88 maintain their distinct wild-type 3-alpha and alpha/beta folds, respectively. To our knowledge, the 3D-structure determination of two monomeric proteins with such high sequence identity but different fold topology is unprecedented. The geometries of the seven nonidentical residues (of 56 total) provide insights into the structural basis for switching between 3-alpha and alpha/beta conformations. Further mutation of a subset of these nonidentities, guided by the G(A)88 and G(B)88 structures, leads to proteins with even higher levels of sequence identity (95\%) and different folds. Thus, conformational switching to an alternative monomeric fold of comparable stability can be effected with just a handful of mutations in a small protein. This result has implications for understanding not only the folding code but also the evolution of new folds.},

Here, we provide a second level of site-specific detail in the transition-state analysis by demonstrating that the scatter of the Hammond plot is related to heterogeneities in the -value growth. That is, the extent of transition-state movement (Delta beta(++)) is proportional to the free-energy gradient of the mutational perturbation across the top of the activation barrier, '(beta(++)) proportional, variant Delta logK(D-N). The analysis is applied to the two-state protein L23 where the site-specific free-energy gradients are used to identify the interactions that show the highest degree of consolidation after crossing the barrier top. These interactions are distributed as a shell around the high- initiation point and denote the side-chain contacts that add criticality to the folding nucleus.},

abstract = {The universe of conformational substates of a protein molecule is huge. The complete energy landscape of proteins is, therefore, complex when studied at low temperature. Many experiments under physiological conditions commonly reveal a simpler spectrum of states. These states are individually ensembles of low temperature substates. That is, room temperature experiments probe the low free energy part of the spectrum of excitations. This paper describes how the complete landscape and the spectrum of these thermally excited motions can be related to each other. On funneled landscapes, partially folded ensembles of states are the most important excited states. Their properties and their free energy spectrum can often be predicted by native topology based models. Frustration, i.e., the conflict between inconsistent stabilizing interactions that have evolved for other purposes than optimizing folding, offers another mechanism for forming low free energy excitations. Frustration can be localized and quantified using energy landscape theory. Symmetry provides an obvious route to low free energy states in oligomeric systems, where simply repositioning parts of the molecule in ways quasi-equivalent to their relation in the native structure gives nearly degenerate energies.},

abstract = {The synergy between structure and dynamics is essential to the function of biological macromolecules. Thermally driven dynamics on different timescales have been experimentally observed or simulated, and a direct link between micro- to milli-second domain motions and enzymatic function has been established. However, very little is understood about the connection of these functionally relevant, collective movements with local atomic fluctuations, which are much faster. Here we show that pico- to nano-second timescale atomic fluctuations in hinge regions of adenylate kinase facilitate the large-scale, slower lid motions that produce a catalytically competent state. The fast, local mobilities differ between a mesophilic and hyperthermophilic adenylate kinase, but are strikingly similar at temperatures at which enzymatic activity and free energy of folding are matched. The connection between different timescales and the corresponding amplitudes of motions in adenylate kinase and their linkage to catalytic function is likely to be a general characteristic of protein energy landscapes.},

abstract = {The mechanisms by which enzymes achieve extraordinary rate acceleration and specificity have long been of key interest in biochemistry. It is generally recognized that substrate binding coupled to conformational changes of the substrate-enzyme complex aligns the reactive groups in an optimal environment for efficient chemistry. Although chemical mechanisms have been elucidated for many enzymes, the question of how enzymes achieve the catalytically competent state has only recently become approachable by experiment and computation. Here we show crystallographic evidence for conformational substates along the trajectory towards the catalytically competent 'closed' state in the ligand-free form of the enzyme adenylate kinase. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that these partially closed conformations are sampled in nanoseconds, whereas nuclear magnetic resonance and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer reveal rare sampling of a fully closed conformation occurring on the microsecond-to-millisecond timescale. Thus, the larger-scale motions in substrate-free adenylate kinase are not random, but preferentially follow the pathways that create the configuration capable of proficient chemistry. Such preferred directionality, encoded in the fold, may contribute to catalysis in many enzymes.},

Neurotransmitter binding triggers a conformational change in the receptor, opening an intrinsic chloride channel and thereby dampening neuronal excitability. Here we present the first three-dimensional structure, to our knowledge, of an inhibitory anion-selective Cys-loop receptor, the homopentameric Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel $\alpha$ (GluCl), at 3.3 \AA resolution. The X-ray structure of the GluCl-Fab complex was determined with the allosteric agonist ivermectin and in additional structures with the endogenous neurotransmitter L-glutamate and the open-channel blocker picrotoxin. Ivermectin, used to treat river blindness, binds in the transmembrane domain of the receptor and stabilizes an open-pore conformation. Glutamate binds in the classical agonist site at subunit interfaces, and picrotoxin directly occludes the pore near its cytosolic base. GluCl provides a framework for understanding mechanisms of fast inhibitory neurotransmission and allosteric modulation of Cys-loop receptors.},

CheY, Spo0F, and NtrC have unrelated functions and low sequence homology but share an identical topology. Recent coarse-grained simulations show that their folding landscapes are uniquely tuned to properly suit their respective biological functions. Enhanced packing in Spo0F and its limited conformational dynamics compared to CheY or NtrC lead to frustration in its folding landscape. Simulation as well as experimental results correlate with the local density of native contacts for these and a sample of other proteins. In particular, protein regions of low contact density are observed to become structured late in folding; concomitantly, these dynamic regions are often involved in binding or conformational rearrangements of functional importance. These observations help to explain the widespread success of Gō-like coarse-grained models in reproducing protein dynamics.},

Coarse-grained representations of the peptide chain have therefore been developed and over the last decade have proved extremely valuable.

We review the many variations of the Gō model that have been employed to yield insight into folding mechanisms. Their success has been interpreted as a consequence of the dominant role of the native topology in folding. The role of local contact density in determining protein dynamics is also discussed and is used to explain the ability of Gō-like models to capture sequence effects in folding and elucidate conformational transitions.},

abstract = {The folding of multidomain proteins often proceeds in a hierarchical fashion with individual domains folding independent of one another. A large single-domain protein, however, can consist of multiple modules whose folding may be autonomous or interdependent in ways that are unclear. We used coarse-grained simulations to explore the folding landscape of the two-subdomain bacterial response regulator CheY. Thermodynamic and kinetic characterization shows the landscape to be highly analogous to the four-state landscape reported for another two-subdomain protein, T4 lysozyme. An on-pathway intermediate structured in the more stable nucleating subdomain was observed, as were transient states frustrated in off-pathway contacts prematurely structured in the weaker subdomain. Local unfolding, or backtracking, was observed in the frustrated state before the native conformation could be reached. Nonproductive frustration was attributable to competition for van der Waals contacts between the two subdomains. In an accompanying article, stopped-flow kinetic measurements support an off-pathway burst-phase intermediate, seemingly consistent with our prediction of early frustration in the folding landscape of CheY. Comparison of the folding mechanisms for CheY, T4 lysozyme, and interleukin-1 beta leads us to postulate that subdomain competition is a general feature of large single-domain proteins with multiple folding modules.},

abstract = {The thermodynamic hypothesis of Anfinsen postulates that structures and stabilities of globular proteins are determined by their amino acid sequences. Chain topology, however, is known to influence the folding reaction, in that motifs with a preponderance of local interactions typically fold more rapidly than those with a larger fraction of nonlocal interactions. Together, the topology and sequence can modulate the energy landscape and influence the rate at which the protein folds to the native conformation. To explore the relationship of sequence and topology in the folding of beta alpha-repeat proteins, which are dominated by local interactions, we performed a combined experimental and simulation analysis on two members of the flavodoxin-like, alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold. Spo0F and the N-terminal receiver domain of NtrC (NT-NtrC) have similar topologies but low sequence identity, enabling a test of the effects of sequence on folding. Experimental results demonstrated that both response-regulator proteins fold via parallel channels through highly structured submillisecond intermediates before accessing their cis prolyl peptide bond-containing native conformations. Global analysis of the experimental results preferentially places these intermediates off the productive folding pathway. Sequence-sensitive Gō-model simulations conclude that frustration in the folding in Spo0F, corresponding to the appearance of the off-pathway intermediate, reflects competition for intra-subdomain van der Waals contacts between its N- and C-terminal subdomains. The extent of transient, premature structure appears to correlate with the number of isoleucine, leucine, and valine (ILV) side chains that form a large sequence-local cluster involving the central beta-sheet and helices alpha2, alpha 3, and alpha 4. The failure to detect the off-pathway species in the simulations of NT-NtrC may reflect the reduced number of ILV side chains in its corresponding hydrophobic cluster. The location of the hydrophobic clusters in the structure may also be related to the differing functional properties of these response regulators. Comparison with the results of previous experimental and simulation analyses on the homologous CheY argues that prematurely folded unproductive intermediates are a common property of the beta alpha-repeat motif.},

An outstanding problem is the construction of a CG model with physically accurate conformational energetics rivaling all-atom force fields. In the present work, atomistic simulations of peptide folding and aggregation equilibria are force-matched using multiscale coarse-graining to develop and test a CG interaction potential of general utility for the simulation of proteins of arbitrary sequence. The reduced representation relies on multiple interaction sites to maintain the anisotropic packing and polarity of individual sidechains. CG energy landscapes computed from replica exchange simulations of the folding of Trpzip, Trp-cage and adenylate kinase resemble those of other reduced representations; non-native structures are observed with energies similar to those of the native state. The artifactual stabilization of misfolded states implies that non-native interactions play a deciding role in deviations from ideal funnel-like cooperative folding. The role of surface tension, backbone hydrogen bonding and the smooth pairwise CG landscape is discussed. Ab initio folding aside, the improved treatment of sidechain rotamers results in stability of the native state in constant temperature simulations of Trpzip, Trp-cage, and the open to closed conformational transition of adenylate kinase, illustrating the potential value of the CG force field for simulating protein complexes and transitions between well-defined structural states.},

However, the quantitative implications of this behavior have remained unclear, largely because the effective theta-state, the central reference point for the underlying polymer collapse transition, has eluded experimental determination. Here, we used single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy and two-focus correlation spectroscopy to determine the theta points for six different proteins. While the scaling exponents of all proteins converge to 0.62 ± 0.03 at high denaturant concentrations, as expected for a polymer in good solvent, the scaling regime in water strongly depends on sequence composition. The resulting average scaling exponent of 0.46 ± 0.05 for the four foldable protein sequences in our study suggests that the aqueous cellular milieu is close to effective theta conditions for unfolded proteins. In contrast, two intrinsically disordered proteins do not reach the $\Theta$-point under any of our solvent conditions, which may reflect the optimization of their expanded state for the interactions with cellular partners. Sequence analyses based on our results imply that foldable sequences with more compact unfolded states are a more recent result of protein evolution.},

We point out the pressing need for a standard nomenclature for peptide conformation and propose such a nomenclature. Finally, we summarize some recent conceptual advances related to the building blocks of protein structure. The results for linear groups imply the need for substantive revisions in how the basics of protein structure are handled.},

@article{Holm1992,
abstract = {The availability of fast and robust algorithms for protein structure comparison provides an opportunity to produce a database of three-dimensional comparisons, called families of structurally similar proteins (FSSP). The database currently contains an extended structural family for each of 154 representative (below 30\% sequence identity) protein chains. Each data set contains: the search structure; all its relatives with 70-30\% sequence identity, aligned structurally; and all other proteins from the representative set that contain substructures significantly similar to the search structure. Very close relatives (above 70\% sequence identity) rarely have significant structural differences and are excluded. The alignments of remote relatives are the result of pairwise all-against-all structural comparisons in the set of 154 representative protein chains. The comparisons were carried out with each of three novel automatic algorithms that cover different aspects of protein structure similarity. The user of the database has the choice between strict rigid-body comparisons and comparisons that take into account interdomain motion or geometrical distortions; and, between comparisons that require strictly sequential ordering of segments and comparisons, which allow altered topology of loop connections or chain reversals. The data sets report the structurally equivalent residues in the form of a multiple alignment and as a list of matching fragments to facilitate inspection by three-dimensional graphics. If substructures are ignored, the result is a database of structure alignments of full-length proteins, including those in the twilight zone of sequence similarity.},

In comparison to popular NMR approaches, mass spectrometry has the advantages of higher sensitivity, wider coverage of sequence, and the ability to analyze larger proteins. Proteolytic fragmentation of proteins following the exchange reaction provides moderate structural resolution, in some cases enabling measurements from single amides. The technique has provided new insight into protein-protein and protein-ligand interfaces, as well as conformational changes during protein folding or denaturation. In addition, recent studies illustrate the utility of hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry toward detecting protein motions relevant to allostery, covalent modifications, and enzyme function.},

We use this technique to predict previously unknown 3D structures for 11 transmembrane proteins (with up to 14 helices) from their sequences alone. The prediction method (EVfold\_membrane) applies a maximum entropy approach to infer evolutionary covariation in pairs of sequence positions within a protein family and then generates all-atom models with the derived pairwise distance constraints. We benchmark the approach with blinded de novo computation of known transmembrane protein structures from 23 families, demonstrating unprecedented accuracy of the method for large transmembrane proteins. We show how the method can predict oligomerization, functional sites, and conformational changes in transmembrane proteins. With the rapid rise in large-scale sequencing, more accurate and more comprehensive information on evolutionary constraints can be decoded from genetic variation, greatly expanding the repertoire of transmembrane proteins amenable to modeling by this method.},

If the change in free energy associated with a structural or functional property of the protein upon a double mutation differs from the sum of changes in free energy due to the single mutations, then the residues at the two positions are coupled. Such coupling reflects either direct or indirect interactions between these residues. Double-mutant cycle analysis can be used to measure the strength of intramolecular and intermolecular pairwise interactions in proteins or protein-ligand complexes with known structure. Double-mutant cycles can also be employed to characterize structures that are inaccessible to NMR and X-ray crystallography, such as those of transition states for protein folding, ligand binding and enzyme catalysis, or of membrane proteins. Multidimensional mutant cycle analysis can be used to measure higher-order cooperativity between intramolecular or intermolecular interactions. In the absence of coupling between residues, prediction of mutational effects is possible by assuming their additivity.},

abstract = {Translocation of biopolymers through pores is implicated in many biological phenomena. Confinement within a pore often breaks ergodicity on experimental and/or biological time scales by creating large entropic barriers to conformational rearrangements of the chain. Here, we study one example of such hindered rearrangement, in which the chain reverses its direction inside a long pore. Our goal is twofold. First, we study the dependence of the time scale of polymer reversal on the pore size and on the polymer length. Second, we examine the ability of simple one-dimensional theories to quantitatively describe a transition in a system with a complex energy landscape by comparing them with the exact rate constant obtained using brute-force simulations and the forward flux sampling method. We find that one-dimensional transition state theory (TST) using the polymer extension along the pore axis as the reaction coordinate adequately accounts for the exponentially strong dependence of the reversal rate constant on the pore radius r and the polymer length N, while the transmission factor, i.e., the ratio of the exact rate and the TST approximation, has a much weaker power law r and N dependence. We have further attempted to estimate the transmission factor from Kramer's theory, which assumes the reaction coordinate dynamics to be governed by a Langevin equation. However, such an approximation was found to be inadequate. Finally, we examine the scaling behavior of the reversal rate constant with N and r and show that finite size effects are important even for chains with N up to several hundreds.},

This model was built for three separate SH3 domains using experimental phi-values as structural constraints in all-atom protein folding simulations. While averaging over all conformations incorrectly considers non-TS conformations as transition states, quantifying structures as pre-TS, TS, and post-TS by measurement of their transmission coefficient ("probability to fold", or p(fold)) allows for rigorous conclusions regarding the structure of the folding nucleus and a full mechanistic analysis of the folding process. Through analysis of the TS, we observe a highly polarized nucleus in which many residues are solvent-exposed. Mechanistic analysis suggests the hydrophobic core forms largely after an early nucleation step. SH3 presents an ideal system for studying the nucleation-condensation mechanism and highlights the synergistic relationship between experiment and simulation in the study of protein folding.},

Simulations also relate topological features to experimentally measured stabilities. Despite many sizable changes in phi values and the structure of the transition state ensemble that result from permutation, we observe a common theme: the critical nucleus in each of the mutants share a subset of residues that can be mapped to the critical nucleus residues of the wild-type. Circular permutations create new N and C termini, which are the location of the largest disruption of the folding nucleus, leading to a decrease in both phi values and the role in nucleation. Mutant nuclei are built around the wild-type nucleus but are biased towards different parts of the S6 structure depending on the topological and entropic changes induced by the location of the new N and C termini.},

The results are analyzed in the context of extensive experimental and evolutionary data. The roles of individual residues in the folding nucleus are identified, and the order of events in the S6 folding mechanism is explored in detail. Interpretation of our results agrees with, and extends the utility of, experiments that shift phi-values by modulating denaturant concentration and presents strong evidence for the realism of the mechanistic details in our MC Go model and the structural interpretation of experimental phi-values. We also observe plasticity in the contacts of the hydrophobic core that support the specific nucleus. For S6, which binds to RNA and protein after folding, this plasticity may result from the conformational flexibility required to achieve biological function.

abstract = {An accurate characterization of the transition state ensemble (TSE) is central to furthering our understanding of the protein folding reaction. We have extensively tested a recently reported method for studying a protein's TSE, utilizing ??-value data from protein engineering experiments and computational studies as restraints in all-atom Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The validity of interpreting experimental ??-values as the fraction of native contacts made by a residue in the TSE was explored, revealing that this definition is unable to uniquely specify a TSE. The identification of protein G's second hairpin, in both pre and post-transition conformations demonstrates that high experimental ??-values do not guarantee a residue's importance in the TSE. An analysis of simulations based on structures restrained by experimental ??-values is necessary to yield this result, which is not obvious from a simplistic interpretation of individual ??-values. The TSE that we obtain corresponds to a single, specific nucleation event, characterized by six residues common to all three observed, convergent folding pathways. The same specific nucleus was independently identified from computational and experimental data, and "Conservation of Conservation" analysis in the protein G fold. When associated strictly with complete nucleus formation and concomitant chain collapse, folding is a well-defined two state event. Once the nucleus has formed, the folding reaction enters a slow relaxation process associated with side-chain packing and small, local backbone rearrangements. A detailed analysis of ??-values and their relationship to the transition state ensemble allows us to construct a unified theoretical model of protein G folding. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In the last 25 years we have come a long way in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity. In 1988, AMPA and NMDA receptors were not even molecularly identified and we only had a simple model of the minimal requirements for the induction of plasticity. It is now clear that the modulation of the AMPA receptor function and membrane trafficking is critical for many forms of synaptic plasticity and a large number of proteins have been identified that regulate this complex process.

@article{Hummer1998a,
abstract = {Proteins can be denatured by pressures of a few hundred MPa. This finding apparently contradicts the most widely used model of protein stability, where the formation of a hydrophobic core drives protein folding. The pressure denaturation puzzle is resolved by focusing on the pressure-dependent transfer of water into the protein interior, in contrast to the transfer of nonpolar residues into water, the approach commonly taken in models of protein unfolding. Pressure denaturation of proteins can then be explained by the pressure destabilization of hydrophobic aggregates by using an information theory model of hydrophobic interactions. Pressure-denatured proteins, unlike heat-denatured proteins, retain a compact structure with water molecules penetrating their core. Activation volumes for hydrophobic contributions to protein folding and unfolding kinetics are positive. Clathrate hydrates are predicted to form by virtually the same mechanism that drives pressure denaturation of proteins.},

abstract = {A molecular model of poorly understood hydrophobic effects is heuristically developed using the methods of information theory. Because primitive hydrophobic effects can be tied to the probability of observing a molecular-sized cavity in the solvent, the probability distribution of the number of solvent centers in a cavity volume is modeled on the basis of the two moments available from the density and radial distribution of oxygen atoms in liquid water. The modeled distribution then yields the probability that no solvent centers are found in the cavity volume. This model is shown to account quantitatively for the central hydrophobic phenomena of cavity formation and association of inert gas solutes. The connection of information theory to statistical thermodynamics provides a basis for clarification of hydrophobic effects. The simplicity and flexibility of the approach suggest that it should permit applications to conformational equilibria of nonpolar solutes and hydrophobic residues in biopolymers.},

In the high-friction (diffusive) limit of Langevin dynamics, the resulting ensemble of transition states is shown to coincide with the separatrix formed by points of equal commitment (or splitting) probabilities for reaching the product and reactant regions. Transition states according to the new criterion can be identified directly from equilibrium trajectories, or indirectly by calculating probability densities in the equilibrium and transition-path ensembles using umbrella and transition-path sampling, respectively. An algorithm is proposed to calculate rate coefficients from the transition-path and equilibrium ensembles by estimating the frequency of transitions between reactants and products.},

abstract = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more 'representations,' in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs.

Here we use mutational analysis to describe the transition state involved in the reversible folding of the beta-barrel membrane protein PhoPQ-activated gene P (PagP) from a highly disordered state in 10 M urea to a native protein embedded in a lipid bilayer. Analysis of the equilibrium stability and unfolding kinetics of 19 variants that span all eight beta-strands of this 163-residue protein revealed that the transition-state structure is a highly polarized, partly formed beta-barrel. The results provide unique and detailed insights into the transition-state structure for beta-barrel membrane protein folding into a lipid bilayer and are consistent with a model for outer membrane protein folding via a tilted insertion mechanism.},

Adopting a theory by Zwanzig [Zwanzig, R. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 2029-2030], we show that, because of roughness characterized by an energy scale epsilon, the unfolding rate at constant force is retarded. Similarly, in nonequilibrium experiments done at constant loading rates, the most probable unfolding force increases because of energy landscape roughness. The effects are dramatic at low temperatures. Our analysis suggests that, by using temperature as a variable in mechanical unfolding experiments of proteins and RNA, the ruggedness energy scale epsilon, can be directly measured.},

CD and HSQC spectra demonstrated that while the double-CI2 protein adopted two kinds of native conformations, CI2-like structure was almost preserved in both the domains of double-CI2. In the folding kinetic studies, double-CI2 exhibited a remarkable rollover of the observed folding rates at low denaturant concentrations, indicating that double-CI2 accumulated a kinetic folding intermediate.

To address the question of partial agonist action at the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor, we performed crystallographic and electrophysiological studies with 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACPC), 1-aminocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (ACBC), and 1-aminocyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid (cycloleucine), three compounds with incrementally larger carbocyclic rings. Whereas ACPC and ACBC partially activate the NMDA receptor by 80\% and 42\%, respectively, their cocrystal structures of the NR1 ligand binding core show the same degree of domain closure as found in the complex with glycine, a full agonist, illustrating that the NR1 subunit provides a new paradigm for partial agonist action that is distinct from that of the evolutionarily related GluR2, AMPA-sensitive receptor. Cycloleucine behaves as an antagonist and stabilizes an open-cleft conformation. The NR1-cycloleucine complex forms a dimer that is similar to the GluR2 dimer, thereby suggesting a conserved mode of subunit-subunit interaction in AMPA and NMDA receptors.},

abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

In this article we use a statistical mechanical model of folding to show that sensitive dependence of multiple transition state ensembles on temperature and the denaturant concentration is the key to resolving the inconsistency among simulations and the experiment. Such sensitivity in multiple transition state ensembles is a natural consequence of symmetry-breaking in a nearly symmetrical protein.},

abstract = {The 64-residue protein chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) is a single module of structure. It folds and unfolds as a single co-operative unit by simple two-state kinetics via a single rate determining transition state. This transition state has been characterized at the level of individual residues by analysis of the rates and equilibria of folding of some 100 mutants strategically distributed at 45 sites throughout the protein. Only one residue, a helical residue (Ala16) buried in the hydrophobic core, has its full native interaction energy in the transition state. The only region of structure which is well developed in the transition state is the alpha-helix (residues 12 to 24). But, the interactions within it are weakened, especially at the C-terminal region. The rest of the protein has varying degrees of weakly formed structure. Thus, secondary and tertiary interactions appear to form concurrently. These data, reinforced by studies on the structures of peptide fragments, fit a "nucleation-condensation" model in which the overall structure condenses around an element of structure, the nucleus, that itself consolidates during the condensation. The high energy transition state is composed of the whole of the molecule making a variety of weak interactions, the nucleus being those residues that make the strongest interactions. The nucleus here is part of the alpha-helix and some distant residues in the sequence with which it makes contacts. The remainder of the protein has to be sufficiently ordered that it provides the necessary interactions to stabilize the nucleus. The nucleus is only weakly formed in the denatured state but develops in the transition state. The onrush of stability as the nucleus consolidates its local and long range interactions is so rapid that it is not yet fully formed in the transition state. The formation of the nucleus is thus coupled with the condensation. These results are consistent with a recent simulation of the folding of a computer model protein on a lattice which is found to proceed by a nucleation-growth mechanism. We suggest that the mechanism of folding of CI2 may be a common theme in protein folding whereby fundamental folding units of larger proteins, which are modelled by the folding of CI2, form by nucleation-condensation events and coalesce, perhaps in a hierarchical manner.},

abstract = {To understand the role of sequence connectivity in protein folding pathways, we explored by Phi-value analysis the folding pathway of an engineered circularly permuted PDZ domain. This variant has the same sequence connectivity as naturally occurring circularly permuted PDZ domains and displays a symmetrical distribution of secondary structure elements (i.e., beta beta alpha beta beta alpha beta beta) while maintaining the same tertiary interactions of the well-characterized second PDZ domain from PTP-BL (PDZ2). Reliable Phi values were obtained for both a low-energy intermediate and the late rate-limiting transition state, allowing a description of both early and late events in folding. A comparison with Phi values obtained for wild-type PDZ2 reveals that while the structure of the late transition state is robust and unaffected by circular permutation, the folding intermediate is stabilized by a different nucleus involving residues located at the new N- and C-termini. The results suggest that folding is driven by competing nuclei whose stabilities may be selectively tuned by circular permutation.},

abstract = {One of the most extreme and fascinating examples of naturally occurring mutagenesis is represented by circular permutation. Circular permutations involve the linking of two chain ends and cleavage at another site. Here we report the first description of the folding mechanism of a naturally occurring circularly permuted protein, a PDZ domain from the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus. Data reveal that the folding of the permuted protein is characterized by the presence of a low energy off-pathway kinetic trap. This finding contrasts with what was previously observed for canonical PDZ domains that, although displaying a similar primary structure when structurally re-aligned, fold via an on-pathway productive intermediate. Although circular permutation of PDZ domains may be necessary for a correct orientation of their functional sites in multi-domain protein scaffolds, such structural rearrangement may compromise their folding pathway. This study provides a straightforward example of the divergent demands of folding and function.},

abstract = {The ability of particle-based coarse-grain potentials, derived using the recently proposed multiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) methodology [S. Izvekov and G. A. Voth, J. Phys. Chem. B 109, 2469 (2005); J. Chem. Phys. 123, 134105 (2005)] to reconstruct atomistic free-energy surfaces in coarse-grain coordinates is discussed. The MS-CG method is based on force-matching generalized forces associated with the coarse-grain coordinates. In this work, we show that the MS-CG method recovers only part of the atomistic free-energy landscape in the coarse-grain coordinates (termed the potential of mean force contribution). The portion of the atomistic free-energy landscape that is left out in the MS-CG procedure contributes to a pressure difference between atomistic and coarse-grain ensembles. Employing one- and two-site coarse-graining of nitromethane as worked examples, we discuss the virial and compressibility constraints to incorporate a pressure correction interaction into the MS-CG potentials and improve performance at different densities. The nature of the pressure correction interaction is elucidated and compared with those used in structure-based coarse-graining. As pairwise approximations to the atomistic free-energy, the MS-CG potentials naturally depend on the variables describing a thermodynamic state, such as temperature and density. Such dependencies limit state-point transferability. For nitromethane, the one- and two-site MS-CG potentials appear to be transferable across a broad range of temperatures. In particular, the two-site models, which are matched to low and ambient temperature liquid states, perform well in simulations of the ambient crystal structure. In contrast, the transferability of the MS-CG models of nitromethane across different densities is found to be problematic. To achieve better state-point transferability, density dependent MS-CG potentials are introduced and their performance is examined in simulations of nitromethane under various thermodynamic conditions, including shocked states.},

abstract = {The reversible folding and unfolding of barley chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) appears to be a rare example in which both equilibria and kinetics are described by a two-state model. Equilibrium denaturation by guanidinium chloride and heat is completely reversible, and the data can be fitted to a simple two-state model involving only native and denatured forms. The free energy of folding in the absence of denaturant, delta GH2O, at pH 6.3, is calculated to be 7.03 +/- 0.16 and 7.18 +/- 0.43 kcal mol-1 for guanidinium chloride and thermal denaturation, respectively. Scanning microcalorimetry shows that the ratio of the van't Hoff enthalpy of denaturation to the calorimetric enthalpy of denaturation does not deviate from unity, the value observed for a two-state transition, over the pH range 2.2-3.5. The heat capacity change for denaturation is found to be 0.789 kcal mol-1 K-1. The rate of unfolding of CI2 is first order and increases exponentially with increasing guanidinium chloride concentration. Refolding, however, is complex and involves at least three well-resolved phases. The three phases result from heterogeneity of the unfolded form due to proline isomerization. The fast phase, 77\% of the amplitude, corresponds to the refolding of the fraction of the protein that has all its prolines in a native trans conformation. The rate of this major phase decreases exponentially with increasing guanidinium chloride concentration. The unfolding and refolding kinetics can also be fitted to a two-state model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {The refolding of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) is, at least, a triphasic process. The rate constants are 53 s-1 for the major phase (77\% of the total amplitude) and 0.43 and 0.024 s-1 for the slower phases (23\% of the total amplitude) at 25 degrees C and pH 6.3. The multiphase nature of the refolding reaction results from heterogeneity in the denatured state because of proline isomerization. The fast phase corresponds to the refolding of the fraction of protein that has all its prolines in a native trans conformation in the denatured state. It is not catalyzed by peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. The rate-limiting step of folding for the slower phases, however, is proline isomerization, and they are both catalyzed by peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. The slowest phase has properties consistent with a process involving proline isomerization in a denatured state. In particular, the activation enthalpy is large, 16 kcal mol-1 K-1, and the rate is independent of guanidinium chloride concentration ([GdnHCl]). In comparison, the intermediate phase shows properties consistent with a process involving proline isomerization in a partially structured state. The activation enthalpy is small, 8 kcal mol-1 K-1, and the rate has a strong dependence on [GdnHCl]. Temperature dependences of the rate constants for unfolding and for the fast refolding phase, both in the absence and in the presence of GdnHCl, were used to characterize the thermodynamic nature of the transition state and its relative exposure to solvent. The Eyring plot for unfolding is linear, indicating that there is relatively little change in heat capacity between native state and transition state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Protein folding barriers result from a combination of factors including unavoidable energetic frustration from nonnative interactions, natural variation and selection of the amino acid sequence for function, and/or selection pressure against aggregation. The rate-limiting step for human Pin1 WW domain folding is the formation of the loop 1 substructure. The native conformation of this six-residue loop positions side chains that are important for mediating protein-protein interactions through the binding of Pro-rich sequences. Replacement of the wild-type loop 1 primary structure by shorter sequences with a high propensity to fold into a type-I' beta-turn conformation or the statistically preferred type-I G1 bulge conformation accelerates WW domain folding by almost an order of magnitude and increases thermodynamic stability. However, loop engineering to optimize folding energetics has a significant downside: it effectively eliminates WW domain function according to ligand-binding studies. The energetic contribution of loop 1 to ligand binding appears to have evolved at the expense of fast folding and additional protein stability. Thus, the two-state barrier exhibited by the wild-type human Pin1 WW domain principally results from functional requirements, rather than from physical constraints inherent to even the most efficient loop formation process.},

abstract = {C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) phosphorylates and down-regulates the Src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs). Crystallographic studies of Csk found an unusual arrangement of the SH2 and SH3 regulatory domains about the kinase core, forming a compact structure. However, recent structural studies of mutant Csk in the presence of an inhibitor indicate that the enzyme accesses an expanded structure. To investigate whether wt-Csk may also access open conformations we applied small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). We find wt-Csk frequently occupies an extended conformation where the regulatory domains are removed from the kinase core. In addition, all-atom structure-based simulations indicate Csk occupies two free energy basins. These basins correspond to ensembles of distinct global conformations of Csk: a compact structure and an extended structure. The transitions between these structures are entropically driven and accessible via thermal fluctuations that break local interactions. We further characterized the ensemble by generating theoretical scattering curves for mixed populations of conformations from both basins and compared the predicted scattering curves to the experimental profile. This population-combination analysis is more consistent with the experimental data than any rigid model. It suggests that Csk adopts a broad ensemble of conformations in solution, populating extended conformations not observed in the crystal structure that may play an important role in the regulation of Csk. The methodology developed here is broadly applicable to biological macromolecules and will provide useful information about what ensembles of conformations are consistent with the experimental data as well as the ubiquitous dynamic reversible assembly processes inherent in biology.},

abstract = {Understanding protein folding and function is one of the most important problems in biological research. Energy landscape theory and the folding funnel concept have provided a framework to investigate the mechanisms associated to these processes. Since protein energy landscapes are in most cases minimally frustrated, structure based models (SMBs) have successfully determined the geometrical features associated with folding and functional transitions. However, structural information is limited, particularly with respect to different functional configurations. This is a major limitation for SBMs. Alternatively, statistical methods to study amino acid co-evolution provide information on residue-residue interactions useful for the study of structure and function. Here, we show how the combination of these two methods gives rise to a novel way to investigate the mechanisms associated with folding and function. We use this methodology to explore the mechanistic aspects of protein translocation in the integral membrane protease FtsH. Dual basin-SBM simulations using the open and closed state of this hexameric motor reveals a functionally important paddling motion in the catalytic cycle. We also find that Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) predicts physical contacts between AAA and peptidase domains of the motor, which are crucial for the open to close transition. Our combined method, which uses structural information from the open state experimental structure and co-evolutionary couplings, suggests that this methodology can be used to explore the functional landscape of complex biological macromolecules previously inaccessible to methods dependent on experimental structural information. This efficient way to sample the conformational space of large systems creates a theoretical/computational framework capable of better characterizing the functional landscape in large biomolecular assemblies.},

abstract = {We report on the use of large-scale distributed computing simulation and novel analysis techniques for examining the dynamics of a small protein. Matters addressed include folding rate, very long time scale kinetics, ensemble properties, and interaction with water. The target system for the study, the villin headpiece, has been of great interest to experimentalists and theorists both. Sampling totaled nearly 500 mus-the most extensive published to date for a system of villin's size in explicit solvent with all atom detail-and was in the form of tens of thousands of independent molecular dynamics trajectories, each several tens of nanoseconds in length. We report on kinetics sensitivity analyses that, using a set of short simulations, probed the role of water in villin's folding and sensitivity to the simulation's electrostatics treatment. By constructing Markovian state models (MSMs) from the collected data, we were able to propagate dynamics to times far beyond those directly simulated and to rapidly compute mean first passage times, long time kinetics (tens of microseconds), and evolution of ensemble property distributions over long times, otherwise currently impossible. We also tested our MSM by using it to predict the structure of villin de novo.},

Complementary spectra of the heme group and of the tyrosine and tryptophan residues were recorded during laser excitation at 436 and 230 nanometers. These spectra reveal a sequence of interleaved tertiary and quaternary motions during the photocycle, motions involving the proximal and distal helices, and the alpha 1 beta 2 subunit interface. This sequence leads to a modified form of the T state, in which the alpha 1 beta 2 interface is deformed as a result of two carbon monoxide molecules binding to the same dimer within the tetramer.},

abstract = {Three bacterial pectate lyases, a pectin lyase from Aspergillus niger, the structures of rhamnogalacturonase A from Aspergillus aculeatus, RGase A, and the P22-phage tailspike protein, TSP, display the right-handed parallel beta-helix architecture first seen in pectate lyase. The lyases have 7 complete coils while RGase A and TSP have 11 and 12, respectively. Each coil contains three beta-strands and three turn regions named PB1, T1, PB2, T2, PB3, and T3 in their order of occurrence. The lyases have homologous sequences but RGase A and TSP do not show obvious sequence homology either to the lyases or to each other. However, the structural similarities between all these molecules are so extensive that divergence from a common ancestor is much more probable than convergence to the same fold. The region PB2-T2-PB3 is the best conserved region in the lyases and shows the clearest structural similarity. Not only is the pleating and the direction of the hydrogen bonding in the sheets conserved, but so is the unusual alphaL-conformation turn between the two sheets. However, the overall shape, the position of long loops, a conserved alpha-helix that covers the amino-terminal end of the parallel beta-helix and stacks of residues in alphaR-conformation at the start of PB1 all suggest a common ancestor. The functional similarity, that the enzymes all bind alpha-galactose containing polymers at an equivalent site involving PB1 and its two flanking turn regions, further supports divergent evolution. We suggest that the stacking of the coils and the unusual near perpendicular junction of PB2 and PB3 make the parallel beta-helix fold especially likely to maintain similar main chain conformations during divergent evolution even after all vestige of similarity in primary structure has vanished.},

Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show how a voltage-gated potassium channel (KV) switches between activated and deactivated states. On deactivation, pore hydrophobic collapse rapidly halts ion flow. Subsequent voltage-sensing domain (VSD) relaxation, including inward, 15-angstrom S4-helix motion, completes the transition. On activation, outward S4 motion tightens the VSD-pore linker, perturbing linker-S6-helix packing. Fluctuations allow water, then potassium ions, to reenter the pore; linker-S6 repacking stabilizes the open pore. We propose a mechanistic model for the sodium/potassium/calcium voltage-gated ion channel superfamily that reconciles apparently conflicting experimental data.},

However, there is a lack of information relating the 4.8 A beta-strand repeat to the higher order assembly of amyloid fibrils. We have used cryo-electron microscopy (EM), combining single particle analysis and helical reconstruction, to characterize these fibrils and to study the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of their component protofilaments. Low-resolution 3D structures of fibrils containing 2, 4, and 6 protofilaments reveal a characteristic, compact shape of the insulin protofilament. Considerations of protofilament packing indicate that the cross-beta ribbon is composed of relatively flat beta-sheets rather than being the highly twisted, beta-coil structure previously suggested by analysis of globular protein folds. Comparison of the various fibril structures suggests that very small, local changes in beta-sheet twist are important in establishing the long-range coiling of the protofilaments into fibrils of diverse morphology.},

abstract = {An unresolved problem in understanding neurotransmitter receptor function concerns the mechanism(s) by which full and partial agonists elicit different amplitude responses at equal receptor occupancy. The widely held view of 'partial agonism' posits that resting and active states of the receptor are in equilibrium, and partial agonists simply do not shift the equilibrium toward the active state as efficaciously as full agonists. Here we report findings from crystallographic and electrophysiological studies of the mechanism of activation of an AMPA-subtype glutamate receptor ion channel. In these experiments, we used 5-substituted willardiines, a series of partial agonists that differ by only a single atom. Our results show that the GluR2 ligand-binding core can adopt a range of ligand-dependent conformational states, which in turn control the open probability of discrete subconductance states of the intact ion channel. Our findings thus provide a structure-based model of partial agonism.},

abstract = {The use of an effective intermolecular potential often involves a compromise between more accurate, complex functional forms and more tractable simple representations. To study this choice in detail, we systematically derive coarse-grained isotropic pair potentials that accurately reproduce the oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function of the TIP4P-Ew water model at state points over density ranges from 0.88 to 1.30 g/cm3 and temperature ranges from 235 to 310 K. Although by construction these effective potentials correctly represent the isothermal compressibility of TIP4P-Ew water, they do not accurately resolve other thermodynamic properties such as the virial pressure, the internal energy, or thermodynamic anomalies. Because at a given state point the pair potential that reproduces the pair structure is unique, we have therefore explicitly demonstrated that it is impossible to simultaneously represent the pair structure and several key equilibrium thermodynamic properties of water with state-point dependent radially symmetric pair potentials. We argue that such representability problems are related to, but different from, more widely acknowledged transferability problems and discuss in detail the implications this has for the modeling of water and other liquids by coarse-grained potentials. Nevertheless, regardless of thermodynamic inconsistencies, the state-point dependent effective potentials for water do generate structural and dynamical anomalies.},

abstract = {We explore the theoretical foundation of different string methods used to find dominant reaction pathways in high-dimensional configuration spaces. Pathways are assessed by the amount of reactive flux they carry and by their orientation relative to the committor function. By examining the effects of transforming between different collective coordinates that span the same underlying space, we unmask artificial coordinate dependences in strings optimized to follow the free energy gradient. In contrast, strings optimized to follow the drift vector produce reaction pathways that are significantly less sensitive to reparameterizations of the collective coordinates. The differences in these paths arise because the drift vector depends on both the free energy gradient and the diffusion tensor of the coarse collective variables. Anisotropy and position dependence of diffusion tensors arise commonly in spaces of coarse variables, whose generally slow dynamics are obtained by nonlinear projections of the strongly coupled atomic motions. We show here that transition paths constructed to account for dynamics by following the drift vector will (to a close approximation) carry the maximum reactive flux both in systems with isotropic position dependent diffusion and in systems with constant but anisotropic diffusion. We derive a simple method for calculating the committor function along paths that follow the reactive flux. Lastly, we provide guidance for the practical implementation of the dynamic string method.},

abstract = {The Dynameomics project aims to simulate a representative sample of all globular protein metafolds under both native and unfolding conditions. We have identified protein unfolding transition state (TS) ensembles from multiple molecular dynamics simulations of high-temperature unfolding in 183 structurally distinct proteins. These data can be used to study individual proteins and individual protein metafolds and to mine for TS structural features common across all proteins. Separating the TS structures into four different fold classes (all proteins, all-alpha, all-beta, and mixed alpha/beta and alpha +beta) resulted in no significant difference in the overall protein properties. The residues with the most contacts in the native state lost the most contacts in the TS ensemble. On average, residues beginning in an alpha-helix maintained more structure in the TS ensemble than did residues starting in beta-strands or any other conformation. The metafolds studied here represent 67\% of all known protein structures, and this is, to our knowledge, the largest, most comprehensive study of the protein folding/unfolding TS ensemble to date. One might have expected broad distributions in the average global properties of the TS relative to the native state, indicating variability in the amount of structure present in the TS. Instead, the average global properties converged with low standard deviations across metafolds, suggesting that there are general rules governing the structure and properties of the TS.},

abstract = {We use molecular dynamics simulations to study osmotically driven transport of water molecules through hexagonally packed carbon nanotube membranes. Our simulation setup comprises two such semipermeable membranes separating compartments of pure water and salt solution. The osmotic force drives water flow from the pure-water to the salt-solution compartment. Monitoring the flow at molecular resolution reveals several distinct features of nanoscale flows. In particular, thermal fluctuations become significant at the nanoscopic length scales, and as a result, the flow is stochastic in nature. Further, the flow appears frictionless and is limited primarily by the barriers at the entry and exit of the nanotube pore. The observed flow rates are high (5.8 water molecules per nanosecond and nanotube), comparable to those through the transmembrane protein aquaporin-1, and are practically independent of the length of the nanotube, in contrast to predictions of macroscopic hydrodynamics. All of these distinct characteristics of nanoscopic water flow can be modeled quantitatively by a 1D continuous-time random walk. At long times, the pure-water compartment is drained, and the net flow of water is interrupted by the formation of structured solvation layers of water sandwiched between two nanotube membranes. Structural and thermodynamic aspects of confined water monolayers are studied.},

abstract = {The tau family of microtubule-associated proteins has a microtubule-binding domain which includes three or four conserved sequence repeats. Pelleting assays show that when tubulin and tau are co- assembled into microtubules, the presence of taxol reduces the amount of tau incorporated. In the absence of taxol, strong binding sites for tau are filled by one repeat motif per tubulin dimer; additional tau molecules bind more weakly. We have labelled a repeat motif with nanogold and used three-dimensional electron cryomicroscopy to compare images of microtubules assembled with labelled or unlabelled tau. With kinesin motor domains bound to the microtubule outer surface to distinguish between alpha- and beta-tubulin, we show that the gold label lies on the inner surface close to the taxol binding site on beta-tubulin. Loops within the repeat motifs of tau have sequence similarity to an extended loop which occupies a site in alpha-tubulin equivalent to the taxol-binding pocket in beta-tubulin. We propose that loops in bound tau stabilize microtubules in a similar way to taxol, although with lower affinity so that assembly is reversible.},

Intriguingly, a large majority of the identified Drosophila proteins are essential developmental proteins and, in particular, most play a role in central nervous system development. Almost half of the human and mouse proteins identified are homeotic homologs. The role of long homopeptides in fine-tuning protein conformation for multiple functional activities is discussed. The relative contributions of strand slippage and of dynamic mutation are also addressed. Several new experiments are proposed.},

Molecular dynamics simulations provide powerful tools for the exploration of the conformational energy landscape accessible to these molecules, and the rapid increase in computational power coupled with improvements in methodology makes this an exciting time for the application of simulation to structural biology. In this Perspective we survey two areas, protein folding and enzymatic catalysis, in which simulations have contributed to a general understanding of mechanism. We also describe results for the F(1) ATPase molecular motor and the Src family of signaling proteins as examples of applications of simulations to specific biological systems.},

@article{Kathuria2008,
abstract = {The beta alpha-repeat class of proteins, represented by the (beta alpha)(8) barrel and the alpha/beta/alpha sandwich, are among the most common structural platforms in biology. Previous studies on the folding mechanisms of these motifs have revealed or suggested that the initial event involves the submillisecond formation of a kinetically trapped species that must at least partially unfold before productive folding to the respective native conformation can occur. To test the generality of these observations, CheY, a bacterial response regulator, was subjected to an extensive analysis of its folding reactions. Although earlier studies had proposed the formation of an off-pathway intermediate, the data available were not sufficient to rule out an alternative on-pathway mechanism. A global analysis of single- and double-jump kinetic data, combined with equilibrium unfolding data, was used to show that CheY folds and unfolds through two parallel channels defined by the state of isomerization of a prolyl peptide bond in the active site. Each channel involves a stable, highly structured folding intermediate whose kinetic properties are better described as the properties of an off-pathway species. Both intermediates subsequently flow through the unfolded state ensemble and adopt the native cis-prolyl isomer prior to forming the native state. Initial collapse to off-pathway folding intermediates is a common feature of the folding mechanisms of beta alpha-repeat proteins, perhaps reflecting the favored partitioning to locally determined substructures that cannot directly access the native conformation. Productive folding requires the dissipation of these prematurely folded substructures as a prelude to forming the larger-scale transition state that leads to the native conformation. Results from Gō-modeling studies in the accompanying paper elaborate on the topological frustration in the folding free-energy landscape of CheY.},

abstract = {The objective of this review is to enable researchers to use the software package Rosetta for biochemical and biomedicinal studies. We provide a brief review of the six most frequent research problems tackled with Rosetta. For each of these six tasks, we provide a tutorial that illustrates a basic Rosetta protocol. The Rosetta method was originally developed for de novo protein structure prediction and is regularly one of the best performers in the community-wide biennial Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction. Predictions for protein domains with fewer than 125 amino acids regularly have a backbone root-mean-square deviation of better than 5.0 A. More impressively, there are several cases in which Rosetta has been used to predict structures with atomic level accuracy better than 2.5 A. In addition to de novo structure prediction, Rosetta also has methods for molecular docking, homology modeling, determining protein structures from sparse experimental NMR or EPR data, and protein design. Rosetta has been used to accurately design a novel protein structure, predict the structure of protein-protein complexes, design altered specificity protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, and stabilize proteins and protein complexes. Most recently, Rosetta has been used to solve the X-ray crystallographic phase problem.},

abstract = {We introduce the strategic development of self-assembling peptide/protein fragments based on the far-red fluorescent protein mPlum. The first beta strand (mPlum 1, 18 amino acids) of mPlum was engineered to spontaneously bind with the rest of the protein (mPlum 2-11, next 10 beta strands) and to form a native chromophore. The target beta strand mPlum 1 was separated from mPlum 2-11 and linked via a flexible peptide linker, resulting in fluorescently inactive circularly permuted mPlum protein (CpmPlum). In vitro evolution of this CpmPlum to a fluorescently active form and the subsequent splitting of the engineered mPlum 1 peptide afforded self-assembling mPlum fragments. Recombinantly expressed and synthetically prepared beta strand peptides were successfully assembled with the remaining mPlum protein in vitro and in cells. This developed pair of peptide/protein fragments was effectively used for peptide tag detection of alpha-synuclein in mammalian cells. Sequential expression of self-assembling mPlum fragments offered an entirely genetically encoded sensing system of naturally unfolded alpha-synuclein.},

We review the molecular basis of these homotypic domain-domain interactions in light of their structure, function and evolution. In addition, we elaborate on three distinct types of asymmetric interactions that were recently identified from the crystal structures of three multimeric, death-fold complexes: the MyDDosome, the PIDDosome and the Fas/FADD-DISC. Insights into the mechanisms of interaction of death-fold domains will be useful to design strategies for specific modulation of complex formation and might lead to novel therapeutic applications.},

abstract = {Structurally conserved residues at protein-protein interfaces correlate with the experimental alanine-scanning hot spots. Here, we investigate the organization of these conserved, computational hot spots and their contribution to the stability of protein associations. We find that computational hot spots are not homogeneously distributed along the protein interfaces; rather they are clustered within locally tightly packed regions. Within the dense clusters, they form a network of interactions and consequently their contributions to the stability of the complex are cooperative; however the contributions of independent clusters are additive. This suggests that the binding free energy is not a simple summation of the single hot spot residue contributions. As expected, around the hot spot residues we observe moderately conserved residues, further highlighting the crucial role of the conserved interactions in the local densely packed environment. The conserved occurrence of these organizations suggests that they are advantageous for protein-protein associations. Interestingly, the total number of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges contributed by hot spots is as expected. Thus, H-bond forming residues may use a "hot spot for water exclusion" mechanism. Since conserved residues are located within highly packed regions, water molecules are easily removed upon binding, strengthening electrostatic contributions of charge-charge interactions. Hence, the picture that emerges is that protein-protein associations are optimized locally, with the clustered, networked, highly packed structurally conserved residues contributing dominantly and cooperatively to the stability of the complex. When addressing the crucial question of "what are the preferred ways of proteins to associate", these findings point toward a critical involvement of hot regions in protein-protein interactions.},

abstract = {Increased levels of brain amyloid-beta, a secreted peptide cleavage product of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is believed to be critical in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease. Increased amyloid-beta can cause synaptic depression, reduce the number of spine protrusions (that is, sites of synaptic contacts) and block long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity; however, the receptor through which amyloid-beta produces these synaptic perturbations has remained elusive. Laur\'{e}n et al. suggested that binding between oligomeric amyloid-beta (a form of amyloid-beta thought to be most active) and the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) is necessary for synaptic perturbations. Here we show that PrP(C) is not required for amyloid-beta-induced synaptic depression, reduction in spine density, or blockade of LTP; our results indicate that amyloid-beta-mediated synaptic defects do not require PrP(c).},

abstract = {We explore the hypothesis that the folding landscapes of membrane proteins are funneled once the proteins' topology within the membrane is established. We extend a protein folding model, the associative memory, water-mediated, structure, and energy model (AWSEM) by adding an implicit membrane potential and reoptimizing the force field to account for the differing nature of the interactions that stabilize proteins within lipid membranes, yielding a model that we call AWSEM-membrane. Once the protein topology is set in the membrane, hydrophobic attractions play a lesser role in finding the native structure, whereas polar-polar attractions are more important than for globular proteins. We examine both the quality of predictions made with AWSEM-membrane when accurate knowledge of the topology and secondary structure is available and the quality of predictions made without such knowledge, instead using bioinformatically inferred topology and secondary structure based on sequence alone. When no major errors are made by the bioinformatic methods used to assign the topology of the transmembrane helices, these two types of structure predictions yield roughly equivalent quality structures. Although the predictive energy landscape is transferable and not structure based, within the correct topological sector we find the landscape is indeed very funneled: Thermodynamic landscape analysis indicates that both the total potential energy and the contact energy decrease as native contacts are formed. Nevertheless the near symmetry of different helical packings with respect to native contact formation can result in multiple packings with nearly equal thermodynamic occupancy, especially at temperatures just below collapse.},

abstract = {Recently the authors proposed a novel sampling algorithm, "statistical temperature molecular dynamics" (STMD) [J. Kim et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 050601 (2006)], which combines ingredients of multicanonical molecular dynamics and Wang-Landau sampling. Exploiting the relation between the statistical temperature and the density of states, STMD generates a flat energy distribution and efficient sampling with a dynamic update of the statistical temperature, transforming an initial constant estimate to the true statistical temperature T(U), with U being the potential energy. Here, the performance of STMD is examined in the Lennard-Jones fluid with diverse simulation conditions, and in the coarse-grained, off-lattice BLN 46-mer and 69-mer protein models, exhibiting rugged potential energy landscapes with a high degree of frustration. STMD simulations combined with inherent structure (IS) analysis allow an accurate determination of protein thermodynamics down to very low temperatures, overcoming quasiergodicity, and illuminate the transitions occurring in folding in terms of the energy landscape. It is found that a thermodynamic signature of folding is significantly suppressed by accurate sampling, due to an incoherent contribution from low-lying non-native IS in multifunneled landscapes. It is also shown that preferred accessibility to such IS during the collapse transition is intimately related to misfolding or poor foldability.},

abstract = {We present a new method for computing interaction potentials of solvated proteins directly from small-angle x-ray scattering data. An ensemble of proteins is modeled by Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics simulation. The global x-ray scattering of the whole model ensemble is then computed at each snapshot of the simulation, and averaged to obtain the x-ray scattering intensity. Finally, the interaction potential parameters are adjusted by an optimization algorithm, and the procedure is iterated until the best agreement between simulation and experiment is obtained. This new approach obviates the need for approximations that must be made in simplified analytical models. We apply the method to lambda repressor fragment 6-85 and fyn-SH3. With the increased availability of fast computer clusters, Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics analysis using residue-level or even atomistic potentials may soon become feasible.},

abstract = {We develop coarse-grained models and effective energy functions for simulating thermodynamic and structural properties of multiprotein complexes with relatively low binding affinity (K(d) >1 microM) and apply them to binding of Vps27 to membrane-tethered ubiquitin. Folded protein domains are represented as rigid bodies. The interactions between the domains are treated at the residue level with amino-acid-dependent pair potentials and Debye-H\"{u}ckel-type electrostatic interactions. Flexible linker peptides connecting rigid protein domains are represented as amino acid beads on a polymer with appropriate stretching, bending, and torsion-angle potentials. In simulations of membrane-attached protein complexes, interactions between amino acids and the membrane are described by residue-dependent short-range potentials and long-range electrostatics. We parameterize the energy functions by fitting the osmotic second virial coefficient of lysozyme and the binding affinity of the ubiquitin-CUE complex. For validation, extensive replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulations are performed of various protein complexes. Binding affinities for these complexes are in good agreement with the experimental data. The simulated structures are clustered on the basis of distance matrices between two proteins and ranked according to cluster population. In approximately 70\% of the complexes, the distance root-mean-square is less than 5 A from the experimental structures. In approximately 90\% of the complexes, the binding interfaces on both proteins are predicted correctly, and in all other cases at least one interface is correct. Transient and nonspecifically bound structures are also observed. With the validated model, we simulate the interaction between the Vps27 multiprotein complex and a membrane-tethered ubiquitin. Ubiquitin is found to bind preferentially to the two UIM domains of Vps27, but transient interactions between ubiquitin and the VHS and FYVE domains are observed as well. These specific and nonspecific interactions are found to be positively cooperative, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the overall binding affinity beyond the approximately 300 microM of the specific domains. We also find that the interactions between ubiquitin and Vps27 are highly dynamic, with conformational rearrangements enabling binding of Vps27 to diverse targets as part of the multivesicular-body protein-sorting pathway.},

abstract = {The ionization of internal groups in proteins can trigger conformational change. Despite this being the structural basis of most biological energy transduction, these processes are poorly understood. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments at ambient and high hydrostatic pressure were used to examine how the presence and ionization of Lys-66, buried in the hydrophobic core of a stabilized variant of staphylococcal nuclease, affect conformation and dynamics. NMR spectroscopy at atmospheric pressure showed previously that the neutral Lys-66 affects slow conformational fluctuations globally, whereas the effects of the charged form are localized to the region immediately surrounding position 66. Ab initio models from SAXS data suggest that when Lys-66 is charged the protein expands, which is consistent with results from NMR spectroscopy. The application of moderate pressure (<2 kbar) at pH values where Lys-66 is normally neutral at ambient pressure left most of the structure unperturbed but produced significant nonlinear changes in chemical shifts in the helix where Lys-66 is located. Above 2 kbar pressure at these pH values the protein with Lys-66 unfolded cooperatively adopting a relatively compact, albeit random structure according to Kratky analysis of the SAXS data. In contrast, at low pH and high pressure the unfolded state of the variant with Lys-66 is more expanded than that of the reference protein. The combined global and local view of the structural reorganization triggered by ionization of the internal Lys-66 reveals more detectable changes than were previously suggested by NMR spectroscopy at ambient pressure.},

abstract = {Thermodynamics and kinetics of off-lattice models with side chains for the beta-hairpin fragment of immunoglobulin-binding protein and its variants are reported. For all properties (except refolding time tau(F)) there are no qualitative differences between the full model and the Go version. The validity of the models is established by comparison of the calculated native structure with the Protein Data Bank coordinates and by reproducing the experimental results for the degree of cooperativity and tau(F). For the full model tau(F) approximately 2 micros at the folding temperature (experimental value is 6 micros); the Go model folds 50 times faster. Upon refolding, structural changes take place over three time scales. On the collapse time scale compact structures with intact hydrophobic cluster form. Subsequently, hydrogen bonds form, predominantly originating from the turn by a kinetic zipping mechanism. The assembly of the hairpin is complete when most of the interstrand contacts (the rate-limiting step) is formed. The dominant transition state structure (located by using cluster analysis) is compact and structured. We predict that when hydrophobic cluster is moved to the loop tau(F) marginally increases, whereas moving the hydrophobic cluster closer to the termini results in significant decrease in tau(F) relative to wild type. The mechanism of hairpin formation is predicted to depend on turn stiffness.},

abstract = {Using exhaustive simulations of lattice models with side-chains, we show that optimized two-state folders reach the native state by a nucleation-collapse mechanism with multiple folding nuclei (MFN). For both the full model and the Go version, there are certain contacts that on an average participate in the critical nuclei with higher probability than the others. The high- (> or = 0.5) probability contacts are largely determined by the structure of the native state. Comparison of the results for the full sequence and the Go model shows that non-native interactions compromise the degree of cooperativity and stability of the native state. From an extremely detailed analysis of the folding kinetics, we find that non-native interactions are present in the folding nuclei. The folding times decrease if the non-native interactions in the folding nuclei are made neutral or repulsive. Using cluster analysis and making no prior assumption about reaction coordinate, we show that both full and Go models have three distinct transition states that give a structural description for the MFN. In the transition states, on an average, about two-thirds of the sequence is structured, whereas the rest is disordered, reminiscent of the polarized transition state in the SH3 domain. Our studies show that Go models cannot describe the transition state characteristics of two-state folders at the molecular level. As a byproduct of our investigations, we establish that our method of computing the transition state ensemble is numerically equivalent to the technique based on the stochastic separatrix, which also does not require a priori knowledge of the folding reaction coordinate.},

@article{Klimov1998a,
abstract = {Background: The most conspicuous feature of a right-handed ?? helix is the presence of hydrogen bonds between the backbone carbonyl oxygen and NH groups along the chain. A simple off-lattice model that includes hydrogen bond interactions using virtual atoms is used to examine the stability, cooperativity and kinetics of the helix-coil transition. Results: We have studied the thermodynamics (using multiple histogram method) and kinetics (by Brownian dynamics simulations) of 16-mer minimal offlattice models of four- turn ??-helix sequences. The carbonyl and NH groups are represented as virtual moieties located between two ??-carbon atoms along the polypeptide chain. The characteristics of the native conformations of the model helices, such as the helical pitch and angular correlations, coincide with those found in real proteins. The transition from coil to helix is quite broad, which is typical of these finite-sized systems. The cooperativity, as measured by a dimensionless parameter, ??(c), that takes into account the width and the slope of the transition curves, is enhanced when hydrogen bonds are taken into account. The value of ??(c) for our model is consistent with that inferred from experiment for an alanine-based helix-forming peptide. The folding time ??(F) ranges from 6 to 1 000 ns in the temperature range 0.7- 1.9 T(F), where T(F) is the helix-coil transition temperature. These values are in excellent agreement with the results from recent fast folding experiments. The temperature dependence of ??(F) exhibits a nearly Arrhenius behavior. Thermally induced unfolding occurs on a time scale that is less than 40-170 ps depending on the final temperature. Our calculations also predict that, although ??(F) can be altered by changes in the sequence, the dynamic range over which such changes take place is not as large as that predicted for ??-turn formation. Conclusions: Hydrogen bonds not only affect the stability of ??-helix formation but also have profound influence on the kinetics. The excellent agreement between our calculations and experiments suggests that these models can be used to investigate the effects of sequence, temperature and viscosity on the helix-coil transition.},

abstract = {The viscosity dependence of the folding rates for four sequences (the native state of three sequences is a beta-sheet, while the fourth forms an alpha-helix) is calculated for off-lattice models of proteins. Assuming that the dynamics is given by the Langevin equation we show that the folding rates increase linearly at low viscosities $\backslash$eta, decrease as 1/$\backslash$eta at large $\backslash$eta and have a maximum at intermediate values. The Kramers theory of barrier crossing provides a quantitative fit of the numerical results. By mapping the simulation results to real proteins we estimate that for optimized sequences the time scale for forming a four turn $\backslash$alpha-helix topology is about 500 nanoseconds, whereas the time scale for forming a beta-sheet topology is about 10 microseconds.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent were applied to predict the hydration free energies for 23 small organic molecules in blind SAMPL2 test. We found good agreement with experimental results, with an RMS error of 2.82 kcal/mol over the whole set and 1.86 kcal/mol over all the molecules except several hydroxyl-rich compounds where we find evidence for a systematic error in the force field. We tested two different solvent models, TIP3P and TIP4P-Ew, and obtained very similar hydration free energies for these two models; the RMS difference was 0.64 kcal/mol. We found that preferred conformation of the carboxylic acids in water differs from that in vacuum. Surprisingly, this conformational change is not adequately sampled on simulation timescales, so we apply an umbrella sampling technique to include free energies associated with the conformational change. Overall, the results of this test reveal that the force field parameters for some groups of molecules (such as hydroxyl-rich compounds) still need to be improved, but for most compounds, accuracy was consistent with that seen in our previous tests.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins play an important role in cellular signalling, mediated by their interactions with other biomolecules. A key question concerns the nature of their binding mechanism, and whether the bound structure is induced only by proximity to the binding partner. This is difficult to answer through experiment alone because of the very heterogeneous nature of the unbound ensemble, and the probable rapid interconversion of the various unbound structures. Here we report the most extensive set of simulations on NCBD to date: we use large-scale replica exchange molecular dynamics to explore the unbound state. An important feature of the study is the use of an atomistic force field that has been parametrised against experimental data for weakly structured peptides, together with an accurate explicit water model. Neither the force field nor the starting conformations are biased towards a particular structure. The regions of NCBD that have high helical propensity in the simulations correspond closely to helices in the 'core' unbound conformation determined by NMR, although no single member of the simulated unbound ensemble closely resembles the core conformation, or either of the two known bound conformations. We have validated the results against NMR spectroscopy and SAXS measurements, obtaining reasonable agreement. The two helices which most stabilise the binding of NCBD with ACTR are formed readily; the third helix, which is less important for binding but is involved in most of the intraprotein contacts of NCBD in the bound conformation, is formed more rarely, and tends not to coexist with the other helices. These results support a mechanism by which NCBD gains the advantages of disorder, while forming binding-competent structures in the unbound state. We obtain support for this mechanism from coarse-grained simulations of NCBD with, and without, its binding partner.},

abstract = {The small (87-residue) alpha-helical protein Im7 (an inhibitor protein for colicin E7 that provides immunity to cells producing colicin E7) folds via a three-state mechanism involving an on-pathway intermediate. This kinetic intermediate contains three of four native helices that are oriented in a non-native manner so as to minimise exposed hydrophobic surface area at this point in folding. The short (6-residue) helix III has been shown to be unstructured in the intermediate ensemble and does not dock onto the developing hydrophobic core until after the rate-limiting transition state has been traversed. After helix III has docked, it adopts an alpha-helical secondary structure, and the side chains of residues within this region provide contacts that are crucial to native-state stability. In order to probe further the role of helix III in the folding mechanism of Im7, we created a variant that contains an eight-amino-acid polyalanine-like helix stabilised by a Glu-Arg salt bridge and an Asn-Pro-Gly capping motif, juxtaposed C-terminal to the natural 6-residue helix III. The effect of this insertion on the structure of the native protein and its folding mechanism were studied using NMR and varphi-value analysis, respectively. The results reveal a robust native structure that is not perturbed by the presence of the extended helix III. Mutational analysis performed to probe the folding mechanism of the redesigned protein revealed a conserved mechanism involving the canonical three-helical intermediate. The results suggest that folding via a three-helical species stabilised by both native and non-native interactions is an essential feature of Im7 folding, independent of the helical propensity of helix III.},

abstract = {We perform folding simulations on 18 small proteins with using a simple Go-like protein model and analyze the folding rate constants, characteristics of the transition state ensemble, and those of the denatured states in terms of native topology and chain length. Near the folding transition temperature, the folding rate k(F) scales as k(F) approximately exp(-c RCO N(0.6)) where RCO and N are the relative contact order and number of residues, respectively. Here the topology RCO dependence of the rates is close to that found experimentally (k(F) approximately exp(-c RCO)), while the chain length N dependence is in harmony with the predicted scaling property (k(F) approximately exp(-c N(2/3))). Thus, this may provides a unified scaling law in folding rates at the transition temperature, k(F) approximately exp(-c RCO N(2/3)). The degree of residual structure in the denatured state is highly correlated with RCO, namely, proteins with smaller RCO tend to have more ordered structure in the denatured state. This is consistent with the observation that many helical proteins such as myoglobin and protein A, have partial helices, in the denatured states. The characteristics of the transition state ensemble calculated by the current model, which uses native topology but not sequence specific information, are consistent with experimental phi-value data for about half of proteins.},

abstract = {Biomolecular machines fulfill their function through large conformational changes that typically occur on the millisecond time scale or longer. Conventional atomistic simulations can only reach microseconds at the moment. Here, extending the minimalist model developed for protein folding, we propose the "switching Gō model" and use it to simulate the rotary motion of ATP-driven molecular motor F(1)-ATPase. The simulation recovers the unidirectional 120 degrees rotation of the gamma-subunit, the rotor. The rotation was induced solely by steric repulsion from the alpha(3)beta(3) subunits, the stator, which undergoes conformation changes during ATP hydrolysis. In silico alanine mutagenesis further elucidated which residues play specific roles in the rotation. Finally, regarding the mechanochemical coupling scheme, we found that the tri-site model does not lead to successful rotation but that the always-bi-site model produces approximately 30 degrees and approximately 90 degrees substeps, perfectly in accord with experiments. In the always-bi-site model, the number of sites occupied by nucleotides is always two during the hydrolysis cycle. This study opens up an avenue of simulating functional dynamics of huge biomolecules that occur on the millisecond time scales involving large-amplitude conformational change.},

abstract = {Unlike random heteropolymers, natural proteins fold into unique ordered structures. Understanding how these are encoded in amino-acid sequences is complicated by energetically unfavourable non-ideal features--for example kinked $\alpha$-helices, bulged $\beta$-strands, strained loops and buried polar groups--that arise in proteins from evolutionary selection for biological function or from neutral drift. Here we describe an approach to designing ideal protein structures stabilized by completely consistent local and non-local interactions. The approach is based on a set of rules relating secondary structure patterns to protein tertiary motifs, which make possible the design of funnel-shaped protein folding energy landscapes leading into the target folded state. Guided by these rules, we designed sequences predicted to fold into ideal protein structures consisting of $\alpha$-helices, $\beta$-strands and minimal loops. Designs for five different topologies were found to be monomeric and very stable and to adopt structures in solution nearly identical to the computational models. These results illuminate how the folding funnels of natural proteins arise and provide the foundation for engineering a new generation of functional proteins free from natural evolution.},

abstract = {A new hierarchical method for the simulation of the protein folding process and the de novo prediction of protein three-dimensional structure is proposed. The reduced representation of the protein alpha-carbon backbone employs lattice discretizations of increasing geometrical resolution and a single ball representation of side chain rotamers. In particular, coarser and finer lattice backbone descriptions are used. The coarser (finer) lattice represents C alpha traces of native proteins with an accuracy of 1.0 (0.7) A rms. Folding is simulated by means of very fast Monte Carlo lattice dynamics. The potential of mean force, predominantly of statistical origin, contains several novel terms that facilitate the cooperative assembly of secondary structure elements and the cooperative packing of the side chains. Particular contributions to the interaction scheme are discussed in detail. In the accompanying paper (Kolinski, A., Skolnick, J. Monte Carlo simulation of protein folding. II.

abstract = {Cellular biochemical networks have to function in a noisy environment using imperfect components. In particular, networks involved in gene regulation or signal transduction allow only for small output tolerances, and the underlying network structures can be expected to have undergone evolution for inherent robustness against perturbations. Here we combine theoretical and experimental analyses to investigate an optimal design for the signalling network of bacterial chemotaxis, one of the most thoroughly studied signalling networks in biology. We experimentally determine the extent of intercellular variations in the expression levels of chemotaxis proteins and use computer simulations to quantify the robustness of several hypothetical chemotaxis pathway topologies to such gene expression noise. We demonstrate that among these topologies the experimentally established chemotaxis network of Escherichia coli has the smallest sufficiently robust network structure, allowing accurate chemotactic response for almost all individuals within a population. Our results suggest that this pathway has evolved to show an optimal chemotactic performance while minimizing the cost of resources associated with high levels of protein expression. Moreover, the underlying topological design principles compensating for intercellular variations seem to be highly conserved among bacterial chemosensory systems.},

Recent experiments have investigated the coupling between the individual steps of single kinesin molecules and ATP hydrolysis, taking explicitly into account forward steps, backward steps, and detachments. A theoretical study of mechanochemical coupling in kinesins, which extends the approach used successfully to describe the dynamics of motor proteins, is presented. The possibility of irreversible detachments of kinesins from the microtubules is explicitly taken into account. Using the method of first-passage times, experimental data on the mechanochemical coupling in kinesins are fully described using the simplest two-state model. It is shown that the dwell times for the kinesin to move one step forward or backward, or to dissociate irreversibly, are the same, although the probabilities of these events are different. It is concluded that the current theoretical view-that only the forward motion of the motor protein molecule is coupled to ATP hydrolysis--is consistent with all available experimental observations for kinesins.},

abstract = {We discuss a coarse-grained approach to the computation of rare events in the context of grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations of self-assembly of surfactant molecules into micelles. The basic assumption is that the computational system dynamics can be decomposed into two parts-fast (noise) and slow (reaction coordinates) dynamics, so that the system can be described by an effective, coarse-grained Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. While such an assumption may be valid in many circumstances, an explicit form of FP equation is not always available. In our computations we bypass the analytic derivation of such an effective FP equation. The effective free energy gradient and the state-dependent magnitude of the random noise, which are necessary to formulate the effective Fokker-Planck equation, are obtained from ensembles of short bursts of microscopic simulations with judiciously chosen initial conditions. The reaction coordinate in our micelle formation problem is taken to be the size of a cluster of surfactant molecules. We test the validity of the effective FP description in this system and reconstruct a coarse-grained free energy surface in good agreement with full-scale GCMC simulations. We also show that, for very small clusters, the cluster size ceases to be a good reaction coordinate for a one-dimensional effective description. We discuss possible ways to improve the current model and to take higher-dimensional coarse-grained dynamics into account.},

abstract = {Proteins can sample conformational states that are critical for function but are seldom detected directly because of their low occupancies and short lifetimes. In this work, we used chemical shifts and bond-vector orientation constraints obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion spectroscopy, in concert with a chemical shift-based method for structure elucidation, to determine an atomic-resolution structure of an "invisible" folding intermediate of a small protein module: the FF domain. The structure reveals non-native elements preventing formation of the native conformation in the carboxyl-terminal part of the protein. This is consistent with the kinetics of folding in which a well-structured intermediate forms rapidly and then rearranges slowly to the native state. The approach introduces a general strategy for structure determination of low-populated and transiently formed protein states.},

abstract = {We analyze the dependence of cooperativity of the thermal denaturation transition and folding rates of globular proteins on the number of amino acid residues, N, using lattice models with side chains, off-lattice Go models, and the available experimental data. A dimensionless measure of cooperativity, Omega(c) (0 < Omega(c) < infinity), scales as Omega(c) approximately N(zeta). The results of simulations and the analysis of experimental data further confirm the earlier prediction that zeta is universal with zeta = 1 + gamma, where exponent gamma characterizes the susceptibility of a self-avoiding walk. This finding suggests that the structural characteristics in the denaturated state are manifested in the folding cooperativity at the transition temperature. The folding rates k(F) for the Go models and a dataset of 69 proteins can be fit using k(F) = k(F)0 exp(-cN(beta)). Both beta = 1/2 and 2/3 provide a good fit of the data. We find that k(F) = k(F)0 exp(-cN(1/2)), with the average (over the dataset of proteins) k(F)0 approximately (0.2 micros)(-1) and c approximately 1.1, can be used to estimate folding rates to within an order of magnitude in most cases. The minimal models give identical N dependence with c approximately 1. The prefactor for off-lattice Go models is nearly 4 orders of magnitude larger than the experimental value.},

abstract = {The common notion in the protein world holds that proteins are synthesized as a linear polypeptide chain, followed by folding into a unique, functional 3D-structure. As outlined in many articles of this volume, this is in fact the case for a great proportion of the proteome. Many proteins and protein domains, however, are intrinsically disordered (IDPs), i.e., they cannot fold on their own, but often undergo a folding transition in the presence of a binding partner. This binding-induced folding process shows strong conceptual parallels with the folding of globular proteins, in a sense that it can proceed via two routes, either induction of the folded conformation from an initial random state or selection of a pre-formed state already present in the ensemble. In addition, we show that IDPs not only undergo folding themselves, they also assist the folding process of other proteins as chaperones, and even contribute to the quality control processes of the cell, in which irreparably misfolded proteins are recognized and tagged for proteasomal degradation. These various mechanisms suggest that structural disorder, in a biological context, is linked with protein folding in several ways, in which both the IDP and its partner may undergo reciprocal structural transitions.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem in the analysis of protein folding and other complex reactions in which the entropy plays an important role is the determination of the activation free energy from experimental measurements or computer simulations. This article shows how to combine minimum-cut-based free energy profiles (F(C)), obtained from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, with conventional histogram-based free energy profiles (F(H)) to extract the coordinate-dependent diffusion coefficient on the F(C) (i.e., the method determines free energies and a diffusive preexponential factor along an appropriate reaction coordinate). The F(C), in contrast to the F(H), is shown to be invariant with respect to arbitrary transformations of the reaction coordinate, which makes possible partition of configuration space into basins in an invariant way. A "natural coordinate," for which F(H) and F(C) differ by a multiplicative constant (constant diffusion coefficient), is introduced. The approach is illustrated by a model one-dimensional system, the alanine dipeptide, and the folding reaction of a double beta-hairpin miniprotein. It is shown how the results can be used to test whether the putative reaction coordinate is a good reaction coordinate.},

Such networks can exhibit many qualitatively different behaviors, separated by critical surfaces. At criticality, we should observe strong correlations in the fluctuations of different genes around their mean expression levels, a slowing of the dynamics along some but not all directions in the space of possible expression levels, correlations of expression fluctuations over long distances in the embryo, and departures from a Gaussian distribution of these fluctuations. Analysis of recent experiments on the gap gene network shows that all these signatures are observed, and that the different signatures are related in ways predicted by theory. Although there might be other explanations for these individual phenomena, the confluence of evidence suggests that this genetic network is tuned to criticality.},

abstract = {An extensive set of equilibrium and kinetic data is presented and analyzed for an ultrafast folding protein--the villin subdomain. The equilibrium data consist of the excess heat capacity, tryptophan fluorescence quantum yield, and natural circular-dichroism spectrum as a function of temperature, and the kinetic data consist of time courses of the quantum yield from nanosecond-laser temperature-jump experiments. The data are well fit with three kinds of models--a three-state chemical-kinetics model, a physical-kinetics model, and an Ising-like theoretical model that considers 10(5) possible conformations (microstates). In both the physical-kinetics and theoretical models, folding is described as diffusion on a one-dimensional free-energy surface. In the physical-kinetics model the reaction coordinate is unspecified, whereas in the theoretical model, order parameters, either the fraction of native contacts or the number of native residues, are used as reaction coordinates. The validity of these two reaction coordinates is demonstrated from calculation of the splitting probability from the rate matrix of the master equation for all 10(5) microstates. The analysis of the data on site-directed mutants using the chemical-kinetics model provides information on the structure of the transition-state ensemble; the physical-kinetics model allows an estimate of the height of the free-energy barrier separating the folded and unfolded states; and the theoretical model provides a detailed picture of the free-energy surface and a residue-by-residue description of the evolution of the folded structure, yet contains many fewer adjustable parameters than either the chemical- or physical-kinetics models.},

Both experimental and theoretical approaches predict a speed limit of approximately N/100micros for a generic N-residue single-domain protein, with alpha proteins folding faster than beta or alphabeta.

Starting from random sequences, low free energy sequences were generated for 108 protein backbone structures by using a Monte Carlo optimization procedure and a free energy function based primarily on Lennard-Jones packing interactions and the Lazaridis-Karplus implicit solvation model. Remarkably, in the designed sequences 51\% of the core residues and 27\% of all residues were identical to the amino acids in the corresponding positions in the native sequences. The lowest free energy sequences obtained for ensembles of native-like backbone structures were also similar to the native sequence. Furthermore, both the individual residue frequencies and the covariances between pairs of positions observed in the very large SH3 domain family were recapitulated in core sequences designed for SH3 domain structures. Taken together, these results suggest that the volume of sequence space optimal for a protein structure is surprisingly restricted to a region around the native sequence.},

abstract = {Upon blue light irradiation, photoactive yellow protein (PYP) undergoes a conformational change that involves large movements at the N-terminus of the protein. We reasoned that this conformational change might be used to control other protein or peptide sequences if these were introduced as linkers connecting the N- and C-termini of PYP in a circular permutant. For such a design strategy to succeed, the circularly permuted PYP (cPYP) would have to fold normally and undergo a photocycle similar to that of the wild-type protein. We created a test cPYP by connecting the N- and C-termini of wild-type PYP (wtPYP) with a GGSGGSGG linker polypeptide and introducing new N- and C-termini at G115 and S114, respectively. Biophysical analysis indicated that this cPYP adopts a dark-state conformation much like wtPYP and undergoes wtPYP-like photoisomerization driven by blue light. However, thermal recovery of dark-state cPYP is ∼10-fold faster than that of wtPYP, so that very bright light is required to significantly populate the light state. Targeted mutations at M121E (M100 in wtPYP numbering) were found to enhance the light sensitivity substantially by lengthening the lifetime of the light state to ∼10 min. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), circular dichroism, and UV-vis analysis indicated that the M121E-cPYP mutant also adopts a dark-state structure like that of wtPYP, although protonated and deprotonated forms of the chromophore coexist, giving rise to a shoulder near 380 nm in the UV-vis absorption spectrum. Fluorine NMR studies with fluorotryptophan-labeled M121E-cPYP show that blue light drives large changes in conformational dynamics and leads to solvent exposure of Trp7 (Trp119 in wtPYP numbering), consistent with substantial rearrangement of the N-terminal cap structure. M121E-cPYP thus provides a scaffold that may allow a wider range of photoswitchable protein designs via replacement of the linker polypeptide with a target protein or peptide sequence.},

abstract = {Whereas previously we have successfully utilized the folding funnels concept to rationalize binding mechanisms (Ma B, Kumar S, Tsai CJ, Nussinov R, 1999, Protein Eng 12:713-720) and to describe binding (Tsai CJ, Kumar S, Ma B, Nussinov R, 1999, Protein Sci 8:1181-1190), here we further extend the concept of folding funnels, illustrating its utility in explaining enzyme pathways, multimolecular associations, and allostery. This extension is based on the recognition that funnels are not stationary; rather, they are dynamic, depending on the physical or binding conditions (Tsai CJ, Ma B, Nussinov R, 1999, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96:9970-9972). Different binding states change the surrounding environment of proteins. The changed environment is in turn expressed in shifted energy landscapes, with different shapes and distributions of populations of conformers. Hence, the function of a protein and its properties are not only decided by the static folded three-dimensional structure; they are determined by the distribution of its conformational substates, and in particular, by the redistributions of the populations under different environments. That is, protein function derives from its dynamic energy landscape, caused by changes in its surroundings.},

abstract = {We propose models for in vitro grown mammalian prion protein fibrils based upon left handed beta helices formed both from the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the proteinase resistant infectious prion core. The C-terminal threading onto a beta-helical structure is almost uniquely determined by fixing the cysteine disulfide bond on a helix corner. In comparison to known left handed helical peptides, the resulting model structures have similar stability attributes including relatively low root mean square deviations in all atom molecular dynamics, substantial side-chain-to-side-chain hydrogen bonding, good volume packing fraction, and low hydrophilic/hydrophobic frustration. For the N-terminus, we propose a new threading of slightly more than two turns, which improves upon the above characteristics relative to existing three turn beta-helical models. The N-terminal and C-terminal beta helices can be assembled into eight candidate models for the fibril repeat units, held together by large hinge (order 30 residues) domain swapping, with three amenable to fibril promoting domain swapping via a small (five residue) hinge on the N-terminal side. Small concentrations of the metastable C-terminal beta helix in vivo might play a significant role in templating the infectious conformation and in enhancing conversion kinetics for inherited forms of the disease and explain resistance (for canines) involving hypothesized coupling to the methionine 129 sulfur known to play a role in human disease.},

abstract = {Surface charges of proteins have in several cases been found to function as "structural gatekeepers," which avoid unwanted interactions by negative design, for example, in the control of protein aggregation and binding. The question is then if side-chain charges, due to their desolvation penalties, play a corresponding role in protein folding by avoiding competing, misfolded traps? To find out, we removed all 32 side-chain charges from the 101-residue protein S6 from Thermus thermophilus. The results show that the charge-depleted S6 variant not only retains its native structure and cooperative folding transition, but folds also faster than the wild-type protein. In addition, charge removal unleashes pronounced aggregation on longer timescales. S6 provides thus an example where the bias toward native contacts of a naturally evolved protein sequence is independent of charges, and point at a fundamental difference in the codes for folding and intermolecular interaction: specificity in folding is governed primarily by hydrophobic packing and hydrogen bonding, whereas solubility and binding relies critically on the interplay of side-chain charges.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the dynamical behavior of proteins, and in particular their conformational fluctuations, is essential to understanding the mechanisms underlying their reactions. Here, transient enhancement of the isothermal partial molar compressibility, which is directly related to the conformational fluctuation, during a chemical reaction of a blue light sensor protein from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 (TePixD, Tll0078) was investigated in a time-resolved manner. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of TePixD did not change with the application of high pressure. Conversely, the transient grating signal intensities representing the volume change depended significantly on the pressure. This result implies that the compressibility changes during the reaction. From the pressure dependence of the amplitude, the compressibility change of two short-lived intermediate (I1 and I2) states were determined to be +(5.6 ± 0.6) × 10(-2) cm(3)⋅mol(-1)⋅MPa(-1) for I1 and +(6.6 ± 0.7)×10(-2) cm(3)⋅mol(-1)⋅MPa(-1) for I2. This result showed that the structural fluctuation of intermediates was enhanced during the reaction. To clarify the relationship between the fluctuation and the reaction, the compressibility of multiply excited TePixD was investigated. The isothermal compressibility of I1 and I2 intermediates of TePixD showed a monotonic decrease with increasing excitation laser power, and this tendency correlated with the reactivity of the protein. This result indicates that the TePixD decamer cannot react when its structural fluctuation is small. We concluded that the enhanced compressibility is an important factor for triggering the reaction of TePixD. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing enhanced fluctuations of intermediate species during a protein reaction, supporting the importance of fluctuations.},

abstract = {Activation of the NMDA subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors requires binding of both L-glutamate and the coagonist glycine. Site-directed mutagenesis of the NMDAR1 (NR1) subunit revealed that aromatic residues at positions 390, 392, and 466 are crucial determinants of glycine binding. Glutamate efficacy was little affected by mutations at these positions; however, inhibition of channel gating by the glycine antagonist 7-chlorokynurenic acid was drastically reduced. In addition, glutamine (Q387), valine (V666), and serine (S669) substitutions were found to reduce glycine efficacy. Since the mutated residues correspond to positions forming the binding site of homologous bacterial amino acid-binding proteins, a common amino acid-binding fold appears to be conserved from prokaryotic periplasmic proteins to glutamate receptors in the mammalian brain.},

Similar results were obtained for the hairpin and helices by using different potentials.

abstract = {Activation of ligand-gated channels is initiated by the binding of small molecules at extracellular sites and culminates with the opening of a membrane-embedded pore. To investigate how perturbations at ligand-binding domains influence the gating reaction, we examined current traces recorded from individual NMDA receptors in the presence of several subunit-specific partial agonists. We found that low-efficacy agonists acting at either the glycine-binding or the glutamate-binding NMDA receptor subunits had very similar effects on the receptor's activation reaction, possibly reflecting a high degree of coupling between the two subunit types during gating. In addition, we found that partial agonists increased the height of all energy barriers encountered by NMDA receptors during activation. This result stands in sharp contrast to the localized effects that have been observed for pentameric ligand-gated channels and may represent a previously unknown mechanism by which partial agonists reduce receptor activity.},

The properties of the repeats and their relative arrangement are thought to be key determinants of spectrin flexibility. Here we report a 2.4 A resolution crystal structure of human erythroid beta-spectrin repeats 8 and 9. This two-repeat fragment is unusual as it exhibits low stability of folding and one of its repeats lacks two tryptophans highly conserved among spectrin repeats. Two key factors responsible for the lower stability and, possibly, its flexibility, are revealed by the structure. A third novel feature of the structure is the relative orientation of the two repeats, which increases the range of possible conformations and provides new insights into atomic models of spectrin flexibility.},

abstract = {Previous X-ray crystal structures have shown that linkers of five amino acid residues connecting pairs of chicken brain alpha-spectrin and human erythroid beta-spectrin repeats can undergo bending without losing their alpha-helical structure. To test whether bending at one linker can influence bending at an adjacent linker, the structures of two and three repeat fragments of chicken brain alpha-spectrin have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The structure of the three-repeat fragment clearly shows that bending at one linker can occur independently of bending at an adjacent linker. This observation increases the possible trajectories of modeled chains of spectrin repeats. Furthermore, the three-repeat molecule crystallized as an antiparallel dimer with a significantly smaller buried interfacial area than that of alpha-actinin, a spectrin-related molecule, but large enough and of a type indicating biological specificity. Comparison of the structures of the spectrin and alpha-actinin dimers supports weak association of the former, which could not be detected by analytical ultracentrifugation, versus strong association of the latter, which has been observed by others. To correlate features of the structure with solution properties and to test a previous model of stable spectrin and dystrophin repeats, the number of inter-helical interactions in each repeat of several spectrin structures were counted and compared to their thermal stabilities. Inter-helical interactions, but not all interactions, increased in parallel with measured thermal stabilities of each repeat and in agreement with the thermal stabilities of two and three repeats and also partial repeats of spectrin.},

abstract = {NMDA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the brain. They are tetrameric complexes composed of glycine-binding GluN1 and GluN3 subunits together with glutamate-binding GluN2 subunits. Subunit-selective antagonists that discriminate between the glycine sites of GluN1 and GluN3 subunits would be valuable pharmacological tools for studies on the function and physiological roles of NMDA receptor subtypes. In a virtual screening for antagonists that exploit differences in the orthosteric binding site of GluN1 and GluN3 subunits, we identified a novel glycine site antagonist, 1-thioxo-1,2-dihydro-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-4(5H)-one (TK40). Here, we show by Schild analysis that TK40 is a potent competitive antagonist with Kb values of 21-63 nm at the GluN1 glycine-binding site of the four recombinant GluN1/N2A-D receptors. In addition, TK40 displayed >100-fold selectivity for GluN1/N2 NMDA receptors over GluN3A- and GluN3B-containing NMDA receptors and no appreciable effects at AMPA receptors. Binding experiments on rat brain membranes and the purified GluN1 ligand-binding domain using glycine site GluN1 radioligands further confirmed the competitive interaction and high potency. To delineate the binding mechanism, we have solved the crystal structure of the GluN1 ligand-binding domain in complex with TK40 and show that TK40 binds to the orthosteric binding site of the GluN1 subunit with a binding mode that was also predicted by virtual screening. Furthermore, the structure reveals that the imino acetamido group of TK40 acts as an $\alpha$-amino acid bioisostere, which could be of importance in bioisosteric replacement strategies for future ligand design.},

Here we show that, by contrast, R15 cannot be engineered to resemble R16 and R17. It is possible to engineer a slow-folding version of R15, but our analysis shows that this protein neither has a rougher energy landscape nor does change its folding mechanism. Quite remarkably, R15 appears to be a rare example of a protein with a folding nucleus that does not change in position or in size when its folding nucleus is disrupted. Thus, while two members of this protein family are remarkably plastic, the third has apparently a restricted folding landscape.},

We found that the TSE possesses a well-defined hydrophobic core with variable enveloping structures resulting from the superposition of three parallel folding pathways. The most preferred pathway agrees with the experimentally determined TSE, while the two least preferred pathways differ significantly. The knowledge of the different pathways allows us to design the interactions between amino acids that guide the protein to fold through the least preferred pathway. This particular design is akin to a circular permutation of the protein. The finding motivates the hypothesis that the different experimentally observed TSEs in homologous proteins and circular permutants may represent potentially available pathways to the wild-type protein.},

abstract = {The formation of structured hydrogen bond networks in the solvation shells immediate to hydrophobic solutes is crucial for a large number of water mediated processes. A long lasting debate in this context regards the mutual influence of the hydrophobic solute into the bulk water and the role of the hydrogen bond network of the bulk in supporting the solvation structure around a hydrophobic molecule. In this context we present a molecular dynamics study of the solvation of various hydrophobic molecules where the effect of different regions around the solvent can be analyzed by employing an adaptive resolution method, which can systematically separate local and nonlocal factors in the structure of water around a hydrophobic molecule. A number of hydrophobic solutes of different sizes and two different model potential interactions between the water and the solute are investigated.},

abstract = {Energetic frustration in protein folding is minimized by evolution to create a smooth and robust energy landscape. As a result the geometry of the native structure provides key constraints that shape protein folding mechanisms. Chain connectivity in particular has been identified as an essential component for realistic behavior of protein folding models. We study the quantitative balance of energetic and geometrical influences on the folding of SH3 in a structure-based model with minimal energetic frustration. A decomposition of the two-dimensional free energy landscape for the folding reaction into relevant energy and entropy contributions reveals that the entropy of the chain is not responsible for the folding mechanism. Instead the preferred folding route through the transition state arises from a cooperative energetic effect. Off-pathway structures are penalized by excess distortion in local backbone configurations and contact pair distances. This energy cost is a new ingredient in the malleable balance of interactions that controls the choice of routes during protein folding.},

abstract = {Functional dynamics of native proteins share the energy landscape that guides folding into the native state. Folding simulations of structure-based protein models, using an minimally frustrated energy landscape dominated by native interactions, can describe the geometrical aspects of the folding mechanism. Technical limitations imposed by the fixed shape of conventional contact potentials are a key obstacle toward advanced applications of structure-based models like allostery or ligand binding, which require multiple stable conformations. Generalizations of existing models, commonly using Lennard-Jones-like potentials, lead to inevitable clashes between their repulsive branches. To resolve these challenges, a new contact potential is developed that combines an attractive part based on Gaussians with a separate repulsive term allowing flexibility for adjustments of the potential shape. With this new model multiple minima for studies of functional transitions can be introduced easily and consistently. A sensitivity analysis for five small proteins confirms the robust behavior of structure-based models with our adaptable potential and explores their capacity for quantitative adjustment of the folding thermodynamics. We demonstrate its ability to incorporate alternative contact distances in simulations of structural transitions for the well-studied ROP dimer. Individual contact pairs can switch between distinct states to match the competing syn and anti structures. The flexibility of the new potential facilitates advanced uses of structure-based models. Depending on the application, features can be chosen from physical considerations or to match experiments. Generalized models can be built from multiple structures to study structural transitions or effects of disorder.},

abstract = {Protein folding into tertiary structures is controlled by an interplay of attractive contact interactions and steric effects. We investigate the balance between these contributions using structure-based models using an all-atom representation of the structure combined with a coarse-grained contact potential. Tertiary contact interactions between atoms are collected into a single broad attractive well between the C($\beta$) atoms between each residue pair in a native contact. Through the width of these contact potentials we control their tolerance for deviations from the ideal structure and the spatial range of attractive interactions. In the compact native state dominant packing constraints limit the effects of a coarse-grained contact potential. During folding, however, the broad attractive potentials allow an early collapse that starts before the native local structure is completely adopted. As a consequence the folding transition is broadened and the free energy barrier is decreased. Eventually two-state folding behavior is lost completely for systems with very broad attractive potentials. The stabilization of native-like residue interactions in non-perfect geometries early in the folding process frequently leads to structural traps. Global mirror images are a notable example. These traps are penalized by the details of the repulsive interactions only after further collapse. Successful folding to the native state requires simultaneous guidance from both attractive and repulsive interactions. Proteins 2011; © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to examine the conformations explored by the agonist-binding domain of the AMPA receptor for wild-type and T686S mutant proteins. Each form of the agonist binding domain showed a dynamic, multistate sequential equilibrium, which could be identified only using wavelet shrinkage, a signal processing technique that removes experimental shot noise. These results illustrate that the extent of activation depends not on a rigid closed cleft but instead on the probability that a given subunit will occupy a closed-cleft conformation, which in turn is determined not only by the lowest energy state but also by the range of states that the protein explores.},

Further, sufficiently accurate forcefields needed to be developed in order to realistically model folding. This decade, however, saw the first reports of folding simulations describing kinetics on the order of milliseconds, placing many proteins firmly within reach of these methods. Progress in sampling and forcefield accuracy, however, presents a new challenge: how to turn huge MD datasets into scientific understanding. Here, we review recent progress in MD simulation techniques and show how the vast datasets generated by such techniques present new challenges for analysis. We critically discuss the state of the art, including reaction coordinate and Markov state model (MSM) methods, and provide a perspective for the future.},

Here we describe a method for studying contact formation between tryptophan and cysteine based on measurements of the lifetime of the tryptophan triplet state. With tryptophan at one end of a flexible peptide and cysteine at the other, the triplet decay rate is identical to the rate of quenching by cysteine. We show that this rate is also close to the diffusion-limited rate of contact formation. The length dependence of this end-to-end contact rate was studied in a series of Cys-(Ala-Gly-Gln)(k)-Trp peptides, with k varying from 1 to 6. The rate decreases from approximately 1/(40 ns) for k = 1 to approximately 1/(140 ns) for k = 6, approaching the length dependence expected for a random coil (n(-3/2)) for the longest peptides.},

Formation of this nucleus is sufficient to establish the complex Greek key topology of the native state. These nucleating residues are highly conserved within the immunoglobulin superfamily, but are less well conserved in the fibronectin type III (fnIII) superfamily, where the requirement is simply to have four interacting hydrophobic residues. However, there are rare examples where this nucleation pattern is absent. In this study, we have investigated the folding of a novel member of the fnIII superfamily whose nucleus appears to lack one of the four buried hydrophobic residues.

Features in the free energy landscapes that govern closure of LBDs are key determinants of binding free energies.

Red cell spectrin is prototypical in being an extensible, multidomain protein widely recognized for its contribution to erythrocyte flexibility. Atomic force microscopy has already shown that single repeats of various spectrin family proteins can be forced to unfold reversibly under extension. Recent structural data indicates, however, that the linker between triple-helical spectrin repeats is often a contiguous helix, thus raising questions as to what the linker contributes and what defines a domain mechanically. We have examined the extensible unfolding of red cell spectrins as monomeric constructs of just two, three, or four repeats from the actin-binding ends of both alpha- and beta-chains, i.e., alpha(18-21) and beta(1-4) or their subfragments. In addition to single repeat unfolding evident in sawtooth patterns peaked at relatively low forces (<50 pN at 1 nm/ms extension rates), tandem repeat unfolding is also demonstrated in ensemble-scale analyses of thousands of atomic force microscopy contacts. Evidence for extending two chains and loops is provided by force versus length scatterplots which also indicate that tandem repeat unfolding occurs at a significant frequency relative to single repeat unfolding. Cooperativity in forced unfolding of spectrin is also clearly demonstrated by a common force scale for the unfolding of both single and tandem repeats.},

abstract = {Pathways of unfolding a protein depend in principle on the perturbation-whether it is temperature, denaturant, or even forced extension. Widely-shared, helical-bundle spectrin repeats are known to melt at temperatures as low as 40-45 degrees C and are also known to unfold via multiple pathways as single molecules in atomic force microscopy. Given the varied roles of spectrin family proteins in cell deformability, we sought to determine the coupled effects of temperature on forced unfolding. Bimodal distributions of unfolding intervals are seen at all temperatures for the four-repeat beta(1-4) spectrin-an alpha-actinin homolog. The major unfolding length corresponds to unfolding of a single repeat, and a minor peak at twice the length corresponds to tandem repeats. Increasing temperature shows fewer tandem events but has no effect on unfolding intervals. As T approaches T(m), however, mean unfolding forces in atomic force microscopy also decrease; and circular dichroism studies demonstrate a nearly proportional decrease of helical content in solution. The results imply a thermal softening of a helical linker between repeats which otherwise propagates a helix-to-coil transition to adjacent repeats. In sum, structural changes with temperature correlate with both single-molecule unfolding forces and shifts in unfolding pathways.},

abstract = {Although modern physics was born in the XVIIth century as a fully deterministic theory in the form of Newtonian mechanics, the use of probabilistic arguments turned out later on to be unavoidable. Three main situations can be distinguished. (1) When the number of degrees of freedom is very large, on the order of Avogadro's number, a detailed dynamical description is not possible, and in fact not useful: we do not care about the velocity of a particular molecule in a gas, all we need is the probability distribution of the velocities. This statistical description introduced by Maxwell and Boltzmann allows us to recover equilibrium thermodynamics, gives a microscopic interpretation of entropy and underlies our understanding of irreversibility. (2) Even when the number of degrees of freedom is small (but larger than three) sensitivity to initial conditions of chaotic dynamics makes determinism irrelevant in practice, because we cannot control the initial conditions with infinite accuracy. Although die tossing is in principle predictable, the approach to chaotic dynamics in some limit implies that our ignorance of initial conditions is translated into a probabilistic description: each face comes up with probability 1/6. (3) As is well-known, quantum mechanics is incompatible with determinism. However, quantum probabilities differ in an essential way from the probabilities introduced previously: it has been shown from the work of John Bell that quantum probabilities are intrinsic and cannot be given an ignorance interpretation based on a hypothetical deeper level of description.},

abstract = {The colicin immunity protein Im7 folds from its unfolded state in 6 M urea to its native four-helix structure through an on-pathway intermediate that lacks one of the helices of the native structure (helix III). In order to further characterize the folding mechanism of Im7, we have studied the conformational properties of the protein unfolded in 6 M urea in detail using heteronuclear NMR. Triple-resonance experiments with 13C/15N-labelled Im7 in 6 M urea provided almost complete resonance assignments for the backbone nuclei, and measurement of backbone 15N relaxation parameters allowed dynamic ordering of the unfolded polypeptide chain to be investigated. Reduced spectral density mapping and fitting backbone R2 relaxation rates to a polymer dynamics model identified four clusters of interacting residues, each predicted by the average area buried upon folding for each residue. Chemical shift analyses and measurement of NOEs detected with a long mixing-time 1H-1H-15N NOESY-HSQC spectrum confirmed the formation of four clusters. Each cluster of interacting side-chains in urea-unfolded Im7 occurs in a region of the protein that forms a helix in the protein, with the largest clusters being associated with the three long helices that are formed in the on-pathway folding intermediate, whilst the smallest cluster forms a helix only in the native state. NMR studies of a Phe15Ala Im7 variant and a protein in which residues 51-56 are replaced by three glycine residues (H3G3 Im7*), indicated that the clusters do not interact with each other, possibly because they are solvated by urea, as indicated by analysis of NOEs between the protein and the solvent. Based on these data, we suggest that dilution of the chaotrope to initiate refolding will result in collapse of the clusters, leading to the formation of persistent helical structure and the generation of the three-helix folding intermediate.},

abstract = {Some protein design tasks cannot be modeled by the traditional single state design strategy of finding a sequence that is optimal for a single fixed backbone. Such cases require multistate design, where a single sequence is threaded onto multiple backbones (states) and evaluated for its strengths and weaknesses on each backbone. For example, to design a protein that can switch between two specific conformations, it is necessary to to find a sequence that is compatible with both backbone conformations. We present in this paper a generic implementation of multistate design that is suited for a wide range of protein design tasks and demonstrate in silico its capabilities at two design tasks: one of redesigning an obligate homodimer into an obligate heterodimer such that the new monomers would not homodimerize, and one of redesigning a promiscuous interface to bind to only a single partner and to no longer bind the rest of its partners. Both tasks contained negative design in that multistate design was asked to find sequences that would produce high energies for several of the states being modeled. Success at negative design was assessed by computationally redocking the undesired protein-pair interactions; we found that multistate design's accuracy improved as the diversity of conformations for the undesired protein-pair interactions increased. The paper concludes with a discussion of the pitfalls of negative design, which has proven considerably more challenging than positive design.},

Our simulation results suggest that the elongation process is dominated by a series of local minimum due to frustration in monomer-fibril interactions. This rugged energy landscape picture indicates that the amount of recycling of monomers at the fibrils’ ends before being fibrilized is substantially reduced in comparison to the conventional two-step elongation model. This picture, along with other predictions discussed, can be tested with current experimental techniques.},

abstract = {We build simple models for the distribution of voting patterns in a group, using the Supreme Court of the United States as an example. The least structured, or maximum entropy, model that is consistent with the observed pairwise correlations among justices' votes is equivalent to an Ising spin glass. While all correlations (perhaps surprisingly) are positive, the effective pairwise interactions in the spin glass model have both signs, recovering some of our intuition that justices on opposite sides of the ideological spectrum should have a negative influence on one another. Despite the competing interactions, a strong tendency toward unanimity emerges from the model, and this agrees quantitatively with the data. The model shows that voting patterns are organized in a relatively simple "energy landscape," correctly predicts the extent to which each justice is correlated with the majority, and gives us a measure of the influence that justices exert on one another. These results suggest that simple models, grounded in statistical physics, can capture essential features of collective decision making quantitatively, even in a complex political context.},

abstract = {Protein-folding mechanisms of two small globular proteins, IgG binding domain of protein G and alpha spectrin SH3 domain are investigated via Brownian dynamics simulations with a model made of coarse-grained physical energy functions responsible for sequence-specific interactions and weak Gō-like energies. The folding pathways of alpha spectrin SH3 are known to be mainly controlled by the native topology, while protein G folding is anticipated to be more sensitive to the sequence-specific effects than native topology. We found in the folding of protein G that the C terminal beta hairpin is formed earlier and is rigid, once ordered, in the presence of an intact C terminal turn. The alpha helix is found to exhibit repeated partial formations/deformations during folding and to be stabilized via the tertiary contact with preformed beta sheets. This predicted scenario is fully consistent with experimental phi value data. Moreover, we found that the folding route is critically affected when the hydrophobic interaction is excluded from physical energy terms, suggesting that the hydrophobicity critically contributes to the folding propensity of protein G. For the folding of alpha spectrin SH3, we found that the distal beta hairpin and diverging turn are parts formed early, fully in harmony with previous results of simple Gō-like and experimental analysis, supporting that the folding route of SH3 domain is robust and coded by the native topology. The hybrid method provides useful tools for analyzing roles of physical interactions in determining folding mechanisms.},

Here we use single-molecule and ensemble assays to address these questions for the papillomavirus E1 helicase. We find that E1 unwinds DNA with a strand-exclusion mechanism, with the N-terminal side of the helicase ring facing the replication fork. We show that E1 generates strikingly heterogeneous unwinding patterns stemming from varying degrees of repetitive movements, which is modulated by the DNA-binding domain. Together, our studies reveal previously unrecognized dynamic facets of replicative helicase unwinding mechanisms.},

abstract = {Spectrin is a vital and abundant protein of the cytoskeleton. It has an elongated structure that is made by a chain of so-called spectrin repeats. Each repeat contains three antiparallel alpha-helices that form a coiled-coil structure. Spectrin forms an oligomeric structure that is able to cross-link actin filaments. In red cells, the spectrin/actin meshwork underlying cell membrane is thought to be responsible for special elastic properties of the cell. In order to determine mechanical unfolding properties of the spectrin repeat, we have used single molecule force spectroscopy to study the states of unfolding of an engineered polymeric protein consisting of identical spectrin domains. We demonstrate that the unfolding of spectrin domains can occur in a stepwise fashion during stretching. The force-extension patterns exhibit features that are compatible with the existence of at least one intermediate between the folded and the completely unfolded conformation. Only those polypeptides that still contain multiple intact repeats display intermediates, indicating a stabilisation effect. Precise force spectroscopy measurements on single molecules using engineered protein constructs reveal states and transitions during the mechanical unfolding of spectrin. Single molecule force spectroscopy appears to open a new window for the analysis of transition probabilities between different conformational states.},

abstract = {A lattice model of protein folding is developed to distinguish between amino acid sequences that do and do not fold into unique conformations. Although Monte Carlo simulations provide insights into the long-time processes involved in protein folding, these simulations cannot systematically chart the conformational energy surface that enables folding. By assuming that protein folding occurs after chain collapse, a kinetic map of important pathways on this surface is constructed through the use of an analytical theory of probability flow. Convergent kinetic pathways, or "folding funnels," guide folding to a unique, stable, native conformation. Solution of the probability flow equations is facilitated by limiting treatment to diffusion between geometrically similar collapsed conformers. Similarity is measured in terms of a reconfigurational distance. Two specific amino acid sequences are deemed foldable and nonfoldable because one gives rise to a single, large folding funnel leading to a native conformation and the other has multiple pathways leading to several stable conformers. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that folding funnel calculations accurately predict the fact of and the pathways involved in folding-specific sequences. The existence of folding funnels for specific sequences suggests that geometrically related families of stable, collapsed conformers fulfill kinetic and thermodynamic requirements of protein folding.},

Since this degree cannot be larger than 1, hyperbolically shaped diagrams are not likely to exist. Experiments show that the correlation factor is actually quite low for proteins implying that one-order parameter is not enough to describe the folding-denaturing transition. These findings seem to be the thermodynamic manifestation of the glasslike properties of proteins despite the fact that the transition itself is of first order.},

abstract = {Models of protein energetics that neglect interactions between amino acids that are not adjacent in the native state, such as the Go model, encode or underlie many influential ideas on protein folding. Implicit in this simplification is a crucial assumption that has never been critically evaluated in a broad context: Detailed mechanisms of protein folding are not biased by nonnative contacts, typically argued to be a consequence of sequence design and/or topology. Here we present, using computer simulations of a well-studied lattice heteropolymer model, the first systematic test of this oft-assumed correspondence over the statistically significant range of hundreds of thousands of amino acid sequences that fold to the same native structure. Contrary to previous conjectures, we find a multiplicity of folding mechanisms, suggesting that Go-like models cannot be justified by considerations of topology alone. Instead, we find that the crucial factor in discriminating among topological pathways is the heterogeneity of native contact energies: The order in which native contacts accumulate is profoundly insensitive to omission of nonnative interactions, provided that native contact heterogeneity is retained. This robustness holds over a surprisingly wide range of folding rates for our designed sequences. Mirroring predictions based on the principle of minimum frustration, fast-folding sequences match their Go-like counterparts in both topological mechanism and transit times. Less optimized sequences dwell much longer in the unfolded state and/or off-pathway intermediates than do Go-like models. For dynamics that bridge unfolded and unfolded states, however, even slow folders exhibit topological mechanisms and transit times nearly identical with those of their Go-like counterparts. Our results do not imply a direct correspondence between folding trajectories of Go-like models and those of real proteins, but they do help to clarify key topological and energetic assumptions that are commonly used to justify such caricatures.},

abstract = {The effect of a solvation on the thermodynamics and kinetics of polyalanine (Ala(12)) is explored on the basis of its energy landscapes in vacuum and in an aqueous solution. Both energy landscapes are characterized by two basins, one associated with alpha-helical structures and the other with coil and beta-structures of the peptide. In both environments, the basin that corresponds to the alpha-helical structure is considerably narrower than the basin corresponding to the beta-state, reflecting their different contributions to the entropy of the peptide. In vacuum, the alpha-helical state of Ala(12) constitutes the native state, in agreement with common helical propensity scales, whereas in the aqueous medium, the alpha-helical state is destabilized, and the beta-state becomes the native state. Thus solvation has a dramatic effect on the energy landscape of this peptide, resulting in an inverted stability of the two states. Different folding and unfolding time scales for Ala(12) in hydrophilic and hydrophobic chemical environments are caused by the higher entropy of the native state in water relative to vacuum. The concept of a helical propensity has to be extended to incorporate environmental solvent effects.},

abstract = {Many cellular functions rely on interactions between protein pairs and higher oligomers. We have recently shown that binding mechanisms are robust and owing to the minimal frustration principle, just as for protein folding, are governed primarily by the protein's native topology, which is characterized by the network of non-covalent residue-residue interactions. The detailed binding mechanisms of nine dimers, a trimer, and a tetramer, each involving different degrees of flexibility and plasticity during assembly, are surveyed here using a model that is based solely on the protein topology, having a perfectly funneled energy landscape. The importance of flexibility in binding reactions is manifested by the fly-casting effect, which is diminished in magnitude when protein flexibility is removed. Many of the grosser and finer structural aspects of the various binding mechanisms (including binding of pre-folded monomers, binding of intrinsically unfolded monomers, and binding by domain-swapping) predicted by the native topology based landscape model are consistent with the mechanisms found in the laboratory. An asymmetric binding mechanism is often observed for the formation of the symmetric homodimers where one monomer is more structured at the binding transition state and serves as a template for the folding of the other monomer. Phi values were calculated to show how the structure of the binding transition state ensemble would be manifested in protein engineering studies. For most systems, the simulated Phi values are reasonably correlated with the available experimental values. This agreement suggests that the overall binding mechanism and the nature of the binding transition state ensemble can be understood from the network of interactions that stabilize the native fold. The Phi values for the formation of an antibody-antigen complex indicate a possible role for solvation of the interface in biomolecular association of large rigid proteins.},

abstract = {Water is essential for life in many ways, and without it biomolecules might no longer truly be biomolecules. In particular, water is important to the structure, stability, dynamics, and function of biological macromolecules. In protein folding, water mediates the collapse of the chain and the search for the native topology through a funneled energy landscape. Water actively participates in molecular recognition by mediating the interactions between binding partners and contributes to either enthalpic or entropic stabilization. Accordingly, water must be included in recognition and structure prediction codes to capture specificity. Thus water should not be treated as an inert environment, but rather as an integral and active component of biomolecular systems, where it has both dynamic and structural roles. Focusing on water sheds light on the physics and function of biological machinery and self-assembly and may advance our understanding of the natural design of proteins and nucleic acids.},

We use a simplified simulation model to survey a range of systems where two highly flexible protein chains form a homodimer. In all cases, this model, which corresponds to a perfectly funneled energy landscape for folding and binding, reproduces the macroscopic experimental observations on whether folding and binding are coupled in one step or whether intermediates occur. Owing to the minimal frustration principle, we find that, as in the case of protein folding, the native topology is the major factor that governs the choice of binding mechanism. Even when the monomer is stable on its own, binding sometimes occurs fastest through unfolded intermediates, thus showing the speedup envisioned in the fly-casting scenario for molecular recognition.},

Here we present a scheme to extract a multiscale state space network (SSN) from a single-molecule time series. Analysis by this method enables us to lift degeneracy--different physical states having the same value for a measured observable--as much as possible. A state or node in the network is defined not by the value of the observable at each time but by a set of subsequences of the observable over time. The length of the subsequence can tell us the extent to which the memory of the system is able to predict the next state. As an illustration, we investigate the conformational fluctuation dynamics probed by single-molecule electron transfer (ET), detected on a photon-by-photon basis. We show that the topographical features of the SSNs depend on the time scale of observation; the longer the time scale, the simpler the underlying SSN becomes, leading to a transition of the dynamics from anomalous diffusion to normal Brownian diffusion.},

abstract = {A new measure is presented to quantify the local topographical feature, i.e., diversity in transitions from a state to the others, on complex networks. This measure is composed of two contributions: one is related to the number of outgoing links from a state (known as degree) and the other is related to heterogeneity in transition probabilities from a state to the others associated with the links. To illustrate the potential of the new measure, we apply it to the multiscale state space networks (SSNs) extracted directly from the single-molecule time series of protein fluctuation of the NADH:flavin oxidoreductase complex by using a recently developed technique [Li, C. B.; Yang, H.; Komatsuzaki, T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008, 105, 536]. We find that the multiscale SSN network structures dependent on the time scale of observation are not differentiated significantly in the topological feature of the SSNs where the connectivity pattern among the nodes is solely taken into account, but instead in the weighted properties of the network including the heterogeneous strengths of transitions and the resident probabilities of the nodes. The relationship of the transition heterogeneity with the anomalous diffusion observed in the single-molecule measurement is also discussed.},

Such a decoupling of folding kinetics from thermodynamics has been observed experimentally for real proteins. From our results, we conclude that specific non-native interactions in the transition state would give rise to straight phi-values that are negative or larger than unity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that residue Ile 34 in src SH3, which has been shown to be kinetically, but not thermodynamically, important, is universally conserved in proteins with the SH3 fold.

The SEA water model computes the free energies of solvation of nonpolar and polar solutes in water with good efficiency and accuracy. However, SEA gives systematic errors in the solvation free energies of ions and charged solutes. Here, we describe field-SEA, an improved treatment that gives accurate solvation free energies of charged solutes, including monatomic and polyatomic ions and model dipeptides, as well as nonpolar and polar molecules. Field-SEA is computationally inexpensive for a given solute because explicit-solvent model simulations are relegated to a precomputation step and because it represents solvating waters in terms of a solute's free-energy field. In essence, field-SEA approximates the physics of explicit-model simulations within a computationally efficient framework. A key finding is that an atom's solvation shell inherits characteristics of a neighboring atom, especially strongly charged neighbors. Field-SEA may be useful where there is a need for solvation free-energy computations that are faster than explicit-solvent simulations and more accurate than traditional implicit-solvent simulations for a wide range of solutes.},

Here, we present the results of nanosecond T-jump experiments probing backbone structure by IR and end-to-end distance by FRET. The folding dynamics observed with these two probes are both exponential with common relaxation times but have large differences in amplitude following their probe-dependent equilibrium unfolding. The quantitative analysis of amplitude and relaxation time data for both probes shows that BBL folding dynamics are fully consistent with the one-state folding scenario and incompatible with alternative models involving one or several barrier crossing events. At 333 K, the relaxation time for BBL is 1.3 micros, in agreement with previous folding speed limit estimates. However, late folding events at room temperature are an order of magnitude slower (20 micros), indicating a relatively rough underlying energy landscape. Our results in BBL expose the dynamic features of one-state folding and chart the intrinsic time-scales for conformational motions along the folding process. Interestingly, the simple self-averaging folding dynamics of BBL are the exact dynamic properties required in molecular rheostats, thus supporting a biological role for one-state folding.},

abstract = {The majority of chemical and biological processes can be viewed as complex networks of states connected by dynamic transitions. It is fundamentally important to determine the structure of these networks in order to fully understand the mechanisms of underlying processes. A new theoretical method of obtaining topologies and dynamic properties of complex networks, which utilizes a first-passage analysis, is developed. Our approach is based on a hypothesis that full temporal distributions of events between two arbitrary states contain full information on number of intermediate states, pathways, and transitions that lie between initial and final states. Several types of network systems are analyzed analytically and numerically. It is found that the approach is successful in determining structural and dynamic properties, providing a direct way of getting topology and mechanisms of general chemical network systems. The application of the method is illustrated on two examples of experimental studies of motor protein systems.},

We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.},

This method can also report the apparent diffusion coefficient and absolute concentration of fluorescent molecules very close to the surface. Theoretical expressions for the fluorescence fluctuation autocorrelation function when both surface association/dissociation kinetics and diffusion through the evanescent wave, in solution, contribute to the fluorescence fluctuations have been published previously. In the work described here, the nature of the autocorrelation function when both surface association/dissociation kinetics and diffusion through the evanescent wave contribute to the fluorescence fluctuations, and when fluorescent and nonfluorescent molecules compete for surface binding sites, is described. The autocorrelation function depends in general on the kinetic association and dissociation rate constants of the fluorescent and nonfluorescent molecules, the surface site density, the concentrations of fluorescent and nonfluorescent molecules in solution, the solution diffusion coefficients of the two chemical species, the depth of the evanescent field, and the size of the observed area on the surface. Both general and approximate expressions are presented.},

abstract = {Influenza hemagglutinin (HA), a homotrimeric glycoprotein crucial for membrane fusion, undergoes a large-scale structural rearrangement during viral invasion. X-ray crystallography has shown that the pre- and postfusion configurations of HA2, the membrane-fusion subunit of HA, have disparate secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, where some regions are displaced by more than 100 \AA. To explore structural dynamics during the conformational transition, we studied simulations of a minimally frustrated model based on energy landscape theory. The model combines structural information from both the pre- and postfusion crystallographic configurations of HA2. Rather than a downhill drive toward formation of the central coiled-coil, we discovered an order-disorder transition early in the conformational change as the mechanism for the release of the fusion peptides from their burial sites in the prefusion crystal structure. This disorder quickly leads to a metastable intermediate with a broken threefold symmetry. Finally, kinetic competition between the formation of the extended coiled-coil and C-terminal melting results in two routes from this intermediate to the postfusion structure. Our study reiterates the roles that cracking and disorder can play in functional molecular motions, in contrast to the downhill mechanical interpretations of the "spring-loaded" model proposed for the HA2 conformational transition.},

Data reveal a small but significant increase of the refolding rate constant (log k(f)) with decreasing contact order. At the same time, the decreased contact order is correlated to losses in global stability and alterations of the folding nucleus. When the differences in stability are accounted for by addition of Na2SO4 or by comparison of the folding kinetics at the transition mid-point, the dependence between log k(f) and contact order becomes stronger and follows the general correlation for two-state proteins. The observation emphasizes the combined action of topology and stability in controlling the rate constant of protein folding.},

abstract = {To explore the plasticity and structural constraints of the protein-folding nucleus we have constructed through circular permutation four topological variants of the ribosomal protein S6. In effect, these topological variants represent entropy mutants with maintained spatial contacts. The proteins were characterized at two complementary levels of detail: by phi-value analysis estimating the extent of contact formation in the transition-state ensemble and by Hammond analysis measuring the site-specific growth of the folding nucleus. The results show that, although the loop-entropy alterations markedly influence the appearance and structural location of the folding nucleus, it retains a common motif of one helix docking against two strands. This nucleation motif is built around a shared subset of side chains in the center of the hydrophobic core but extends in different directions of the S6 structure following the permutant-specific differences in local loop entropies. The adjustment of the critical folding nucleus to alterations in loop entropies is reflected by a direct correlation between the phi-value change and the accompanying change in local sequence separation.},

abstract = {Although the structures of native proteins are generally unique, the pathways by which they form are often free to vary. Some proteins fold by a multitude of different pathways, whereas others seem restricted to only one choice. An explanation for this variation in folding behaviour has recently emerged from studies of transition state changes: the number of accessible pathways is linked to the number of nucleation motifs contained within the native topology. We refer to these nucleation motifs as 'foldons', as they approach the size of an independent cooperative unit. Thus, with respect to pathway malleability and the composition of the folding funnel, proteins can be seen as modular assemblies of competing foldons. For the split beta-alpha-beta fold, these foldons are two-strand-helix motifs coupled by spatial overlap.},

abstract = {Reversing the loop lengths of the small protein S6 by circular permutation has a dramatic effect on the transition state structure: it changes from globally diffuse to locally condensed. The phenomenon arises from a biased dispersion of the contact energies. Stability data derived from point mutations throughout the S6 structure show that interactions between residues that are far apart in sequence are stronger than those that are close. This entropy compensation drives all parts of the protein to fold simultaneously and produces the diffuse transition-state structure typical for two-state proteins. In the circular permutant, where strong contacts and short sequence separations are engineered to concur, the transition state becomes atypically condensed and polarized. Taken together with earlier findings that S6 may also fold by a 'collapsed' trajectory with an intermediate, the results suggest that this protein may fold by a multiplicity of mechanisms. The observations indicate that the diffuse transition state of S6 is not required for folding but could be an evolutionary development to optimize cooperativity.},

We illustrate the method for human ubiquitin in solution and find that there is considerable conformational heterogeneity throughout the protein structure. The interior atoms of the protein are tightly packed in each individual conformation that contributes to the ensemble but their overall behaviour can be described as having a significant degree of liquid-like character.

Here we present a systematic and extensive evaluation of eight different protein force fields based on comparisons of experimental data with molecular dynamics simulations that reach a previously inaccessible timescale. First, through extensive comparisons with experimental NMR data, we examined the force fields' abilities to describe the structure and fluctuations of folded proteins. Second, we quantified potential biases towards different secondary structure types by comparing experimental and simulation data for small peptides that preferentially populate either helical or sheet-like structures. Third, we tested the force fields' abilities to fold two small proteins--one $\alpha$-helical, the other with $\beta$-sheet structure. The results suggest that force fields have improved over time, and that the most recent versions, while not perfect, provide an accurate description of many structural and dynamical properties of proteins.},

In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form.

abstract = {The mechanism by which proteins fold to their native states has been the focus of intense research in recent years. The rate-limiting event in the folding reaction is the formation of a conformation in a set known as the transition-state ensemble. The structural features present within such ensembles have now been analysed for a series of proteins using data from a combination of biochemical and biophysical experiments together with computer-simulation methods. These studies show that the topology of the transition state is determined by a set of interactions involving a small number of key residues and, in addition, that the topology of the transition state is closer to that of the native state than to that of any other fold in the protein universe. Here, we review the evidence for these conclusions and suggest a molecular mechanism that rationalizes these findings by presenting a view of protein folds that is based on the topological features of the polypeptide backbone, rather than the conventional view that depends on the arrangement of different types of secondary-structure elements. By linking the folding process to the organization of the protein structure universe, we propose an explanation for the overwhelming importance of topology in the transition states for protein folding.},

abstract = {The five-helix bundle lambda6-85* is a fast two-state folder. Several stabilized mutants have been reported to fold kinetically near-downhill or downhill. These mutants undergo a transition to two-state folding kinetics when heated. It has been suggested that this transition is caused by increased hydrophobicity at higher temperature. Here we investigate two histidine-containing mutants of lambda6-85* to see if a weaker hydrophobic core can extend the temperature range of downhill folding. The very stable lambdaHA is the fastest-folding lambda repressor to date (k(f)(-1) approximately k(obs)(-1)=2.3 micros at 44 degrees C). It folds downhill at low temperature, but transits back to two-state folding at its unfolding midpoint. lambdaHG has a weakened hydrophobic core. It is less stable than some slower folding mutants of lambda6-85*, and it has more exposed hydrophobic surface area in the folded state. This mutant nonetheless folds very rapidly, and has the non-exponential folding kinetics of an incipient downhill folder even at the unfolding midpoint (k(m)(-1) approximately 2 micros, k(a)(-1)=15 micros at 56 degrees C). We also compare the thermodynamic melting transition of lambdaHG with the nominal two-state folding mutant lambdaQG, which has a similar melting temperature. Unlike lambdaQG, lambdaHG yields fluorescence wavelength-dependent cooperativities and probe-dependent melting temperatures. This result combined with previous work shows that the energy landscapes of lambda repressor mutants support all standard folding mechanisms.},

abstract = {Marked hydration changes occur during the self-assembly of the melittin protein tetramer in water. Hydrophobicity induces a drying transition in the gap between simple sufficiently large (more than 1 nm(2)) strongly hydrophobic surfaces as they approach each other, resulting in the subsequent collapse of the system, as well as a depletion of water next to single surfaces. Here we investigate whether the hydrophobic induced collapse of multidomain proteins or the formation of protein oligimers exhibits a similar drying transition. We performed computer simulations to study the collapse of the tetramer of melittin in water, and observed a marked water drying transition inside a nanoscale channel of the tetramer (with a channel size of up to two or three water-molecule diameters). This transition, although occurring on a microscopic length scale, is analogous to a first-order phase transition from liquid to vapour. We find that this drying is very sensitive to single mutations of the three isoleucines to less hydrophobic residues and that such mutations in the right locations can switch the channel from being dry to being wet. Thus, quite subtle changes in hydrophobic surface topology can profoundly influence the drying transition. We show that, even in the presence of the polar protein backbone, sufficiently hydrophobic protein surfaces can induce a liquid-vapour transition providing an enormous driving force towards further collapse. This behaviour was unexpected because of the absence of drying in the collapse of the multidomain protein 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase (BphC).},

abstract = {As different parts of a protein chain approach one another during folding, they are expected to encounter desolvation barriers before optimal packing is achieved. This impediment originates from the water molecule's finite size, which entails a net energetic cost for water exclusion when the formation of compensating close intraprotein contacts is not yet complete. Based on recent advances, we extend our exploration of these microscopic elementary desolvation barriers' roles in the emergence of generic properties of protein folding. Using continuum Gō-like C(alpha) chain models of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) and barnase as examples, we underscore that elementary desolvation barriers between a protein's constituent groups can significantly reduce native conformational fluctuations relative to model predictions that neglected these barriers. An increasing height of elementary desolvation barriers leads to thermodynamically more cooperative folding/unfolding transitions (i.e., higher overall empirical folding barriers) and higher degrees of kinetic cooperativity as manifested by more linear rate-stability relationships under constant temperature. Applying a spatially non-uniform thermodynamic parametrization we recently introduced for the pairwise C(alpha) potentials of mean force, the present barnase model further illustrates that desolvation is a probable physical underpinning for the experimentally observed high intrinsic enthalpic folding barrier under isostability conditions.},

abstract = {Experimental data from global analyses of temperature (T) and denaturant dependence of the folding rates of small proteins led to an intrinsic enthalpic folding barrier hypothesis: to a good approximation, the T-dependence of folding rate under constant native stability conditions is Arrhenius. Furthermore, for a given protein, the slope of isostability folding rate versus 1/T is essentially independent of native stability. This hypothesis implies a simple relationship between chevron and Eyring plots of folding that is easily discernible when both sets of rates are expressed as functions of native stability. Using experimental data in the literature, we verify the predicted chevron-Eyring relationship for 14 proteins and determine their intrinsic enthalpic folding barriers, which vary approximately from 15 kcal/mol to 40 kcal/mol for different proteins. These enthalpic barriers do not appear to correlate with folding rates, but they exhibit correlation with equilibrium unfolding enthalpy at room temperature. Intrinsic enthalpic barriers with similarly high magnitudes apply as well to at least two cases of peptide-peptide and peptide-protein association, suggesting that these barriers are a hallmark of certain general and fundamental kinetic processes during folding and binding. Using a class of explicit-chain C(alpha) protein models with constant elementary enthalpic desolvation barriers between C(alpha) positions, we show that small microscopic pairwise desolvation barriers, which are a direct consequence of the particulate nature of water, can act cooperatively to give rise to a significant overall enthalpic barrier to folding. This theoretical finding provides a physical rationalization for the high intrinsic enthalpic barriers in protein folding energetics. Ramifications of entropy-enthalpy compensation in hydrophobic association for the height of enthalpic desolvation barrier are discussed.},

abstract = {In this work we study the folding kinetics of Che Y mutants in which the helical propensity of each of its five alpha-helices has been greatly enhanced by local interactions (between residues close in sequence). This constitutes an experimental test on the role of local interactions in protein folding, as well as providing new information on the details of the folding pathway of the protein Che Y. With respect to the first issue, our results show that the enhancement of helical propensities by native-like local interactions in Che Y has the following general effects: (1) the energetics of the whole Che Y folding energy landscape (folded state, intermediate, denatured state and main transition state) are affected by the enhancement of helical propensities, thus, native-like local interactions appear to have a low specificity for the native conformation; (2) our results support the idea, proposed from thermodynamic analysis of the mutants, that the denatured state under native conditions becomes more compact upon enhancement of helical propensities; (3) the rate of folding in aqueous solution decreases in all the mutants, suggesting that the optimization of the folding rate in this protein requires low secondary structure propensities. Regarding the description of the folding pathway of Che Y, we find evidence that the folding transition state of Che Y is constituted by two sub-domains with different degree of helical structure. The first includes helices 1 and 2 which are rather structured, while the second encompasses the last three helices, which are very unstructured. On the other hand, the same analysis for the folding intermediate indicates that all the five alpha-helices are, on average, rather structured. Thus, suggesting that a large structural reorganization of the last three alpha-helices must take place before folding can be completed. This conclusion indicates that the folding intermediate of Che Y is a misfolded species.},

@article{Lopez-Hernandez1996,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein engineering analysis has been used as a tool to determine the structure of the transition state of two different proteins: CI-2 and barnase. CI-2 belongs to the group of small, globular proteins with no disulphide bonds that fold via a two-state mechanism. Barnase is a larger protein (110 aa) and displays a folding intermediate. The structure of the transition state of both proteins is quite different. Whereas in CI-2 no region is fully native and it looks like an expanded form of the folded state, in barnase several regions are folded and the rate-limiting step seems to be the consolidation of the hydrophobic core. On the basis of these results, a unified scheme for the transition state of protein folding has been presented. We decided to characterize the folding pathway, or pathways, present in the alpha/beta parallel family of proteins using one of the smallest members, CheY (129 aa), as a model case.

RESULTS: The folding pathway of CheY contains, as does that of barnase, a kinetic intermediate. The picture obtained for CheY from the equilibrium and kinetic analyses of several mutations scattered throughout the whole protein is different from that found for barnase. On the basis of the experimental results and the structure of CheY, the protein can be divided into two subdomains (from beta-strand 1 to beta-strand 3 and from beta-strand 3 to the C terminus). Whereas the structure of the first subdomain in the transition state resembles that found for the CI-2 protein, the second subdomain is compact but unstructured. The packing of the first alpha-helix against beta-strands 1 and 2 seems to be the nucleus around which the rest of the protein folds.

CONCLUSIONS: Comparison of the transition state of barnase with those of CheY and CI-2 indicates that different proteins have different transition states, probably depending on the energetics and the position of the rate-limiting step in the folding pathway. CheY appears to fold through a nucleation/condensation mechanism as has been found for CI-2. The rate-determining step in some multimodular proteins could be the formation of a stable domain, with the less stable domains folding after the major rate-determining step.},

abstract = {The modular structures of repeat proteins afford them distinct properties compared with globular proteins, enabling them to function in a large and diverse range of cellular processes. Here, we show that they can also have different folding mechanisms. Myotrophin comprises four ankyrin repeats stacked linearly to form an elongated structure. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we find that folding of wild-type myotrophin is initiated at the C-terminal repeats. However, close examination of the mutant chevron plots reveals that simple models are insufficient to describe all of the data, and double mutant analysis subsequently confirms that there are parallel folding pathways. Destabilizing mutations in the C-terminal repeats reduce flux through the wild-type pathway, making a new route accessible in which folding is initiated at the N-terminal repeats. Thus, the folding mechanism of the repeat protein is poised on a fulcrum: When one end of the molecule is perturbed, the balance shifts between the different nucleation sites. The vast majority of studies on small globular proteins indicate a single, well defined route between the denatured and native states. By contrast, the potential to initiate folding at more than one site may be a general feature of repeat proteins arising from the symmetry inherent in their structures. We show that this simple architecture makes it straightforward to direct the folding pathway of a repeat protein by design.},

abstract = {We developed a coarse grained two-well model to study the single molecule protein conformational dynamics in microscopic detail at the residue level, overcoming the often encountered computational bottleneck. In particular, we explored the underlying conformational energy landscape of adenylate kinase, a crucial protein for signal transduction in the cell, and identified two major kinetic pathways for the conformational switch between open and closed states through either the intermediate state or the transient state. Based on the parameters fitted to the room-temperature experimental data, we predicted open and closed kinetic rates at the whole temperature ranges from 10 to 50 degrees C, which agree well with the experimental turnover numbers. After uncovering the underlying mechanism for conformational dynamics and exploring the structural correlations, we found the crucial dynamical interplay between the nucleoside monophosphate binding domain (NMP) and the ATP-binding domain (LID) in controlling the conformational switch. The key residues and contacts responsible for the conformational transitions are identified by following the time evolution of the two-dimensional spatial contact maps and characterizing the transition state as well as intermediate structure ensembles through phi value analysis. Our model provides a general framework to study the conformational dynamics of biomolecules and can be applied to many other systems.},

abstract = {The fluctuation-dissipation theorem, one of the central theorems in thermal dynamics, breaks down in out-of-equilibrium systems. The idea of effective temperature coming from the extensions of that theorem has been recently introduced to study glasses and has proved to be a key concept for out-of-equilibrium systems. Gene networks involve stochastic chemical kinetics and are far from equilibrium. This leads us to try to use the notion of effective temperature to study them. To develop this idea, we study a simple birth-death process and a general two-species interacting process using the language of effective temperature. Furthermore, a model of a nonregulatory gene is studied as an example. The effective temperature may serves as an alternative and somewhat more fundamental language to describe the intrinsic-extrinsic noise distinction that has already provided a tool for qualifying gene networks.},

abstract = {The random first-order transition theory of the dynamics of supercooled liquids is extended to treat aging phenomena in nonequilibrium structural glasses. A reformulation of the idea of "entropic droplets" in terms of libraries of local energy landscapes is introduced which treats in a uniform way the supercooled liquid (reproducing earlier results) and glassy regimes. The resulting microscopic theory of aging makes contact with the Nayaranaswamy-Moynihan-Tool nonlinear relaxation formalism and the Hodge-Scherer extrapolation of the Adam-Gibbs formula, but deviations from both approaches are predicted and shown to be consistent with experiment. The nonlinearity of glassy relaxation is shown to quantitatively correlate with liquid fragility. The residual non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of relaxation observed in quenched glasses is explained. The broadening of relaxation spectra in the nonequilibrium glass with decreasing temperature is quantitatively predicted. The theory leads to the prediction of spatially fluctuating fictive temperatures in the long-aged glassy state, which have non-Gaussian statistics. This can give rise to "ultraslow" relaxations in systems after deep quenches.},

abstract = {We report the results of molecular dynamics simulations of an off-lattice protein model featuring a physical force-field and amino-acid sequence. We show that localized modes of nonlinear origin, discrete breathers (DBs), emerge naturally as continuations of a subset of high-frequency normal modes residing at specific sites dictated by the native fold. DBs are time-periodic, space-localized vibrational modes that exist generically in nonlinear discrete systems and are known for their resilience and ability to concentrate energy for long times. In the case of the small $\beta$-barrel structure that we consider, DB-mediated localization occurs on the turns connecting the strands. At high energies, DBs stabilize the structure by concentrating energy on a few sites, while their collapse marks the onset of large-amplitude fluctuations of the protein. Furthermore, we show how breathers develop as energy-accumulating centres following perturbations even at distant locations, thus mediating efficient and irreversible energy transfers. Remarkably, due to the presence of angular potentials, the breather induces a local static distortion of the native fold. Altogether, the combination of these two nonlinear effects may provide a ready means for remotely controlling local conformational changes in proteins.},

abstract = {Since the onset of the genomic era more than 1000 bacterial genomes have been sequenced and several fold more are expected to be completed in the near future. These genome sequences supply a wealth of information that can be exploited by statistical methods to gain significant insights into cellular processes. In Volume 422 of Methods in Enzymology we described a covariance-based method, which was able to identify coevolving residue pairs between the ubiquitous bacterial two-component signal transduction proteins, the sensor kinase and the response regulator. Such residue position pairs supply interaction specificity in the light of highly amplified but structurally conserved two-component systems in a typical bacterium and are enriched with interaction surface residue pairings. In this chapter we describe an extended version of this method, termed "direct coupling analysis" (DCA), which greatly enhances the predictive power of traditional covariance analysis. DCA introduces a statistical inference step to covariance analysis, which allows to distinguish coevolution patterns introduced by direct correlations between two-residue positions, from those patterns that arise via indirect correlations, that is, correlations that are introduced by covariance with other residues in the respective proteins. This method was shown to reliably identify residue positions in spatial proximity within a protein or at the interface between two interaction partners. It is the goal of this chapter to allow an experienced programmer to reproduce our techniques and results so that DCA can soon be applied to new targets.},

abstract = {Although atomistic simulations of proteins and other biological systems are approaching microsecond timescales, the quality of simulation trajectories has remained difficult to assess. Such assessment is critical not only for establishing the relevance of any individual simulation but also in the extremely active field of developing computational methods. Here we map the trajectory assessment problem onto a simple statistical calculation of the "effective sample size", that is, the number of statistically independent configurations. The mapping is achieved by asking the question, "How much time must elapse between snapshots included in a sample for that sample to exhibit the statistical properties expected for independent and identically distributed configurations?" Our method is more general than autocorrelation methods in that it directly probes the configuration-space distribution without requiring a priori definition of configurational substates and without any fitting parameters. We show that the method is equally and directly applicable to toy models, peptides, and a 72-residue protein model. Variants of our approach can readily be applied to a wide range of physical and chemical systems.},

abstract = {Most proteins consist of multiple domains. How do linkers efficiently transfer information between sites that are on different domains to activate the protein? Mere flexibility only implies that the conformations would be sampled. For fast timescales between triggering events and cellular response, which often involves large conformational change, flexibility on its own may not constitute a good solution. We posit that successive conformational states along major allosteric propagation pathways are pre-encoded in linker sequences where each state is encoded by the previous one. The barriers between these states that are hierarchically populated are lower, achieving faster timescales even for large conformational changes. We further propose that evolution has optimized the linker sequences and lengths for efficiency, which explains why mutations in linkers may affect protein function and review the literature in this light.},

The IR- and fluorescence-detected relaxation time scales converge when the native bias is removed by raising the temperature, recovering activated two-state folding. Langevin dynamics simulations on one- and 2D free energy surfaces tunable from two-state to downhill folding reproduce the difference between the IR and fluorescence experiments, as well as the temperature and viscosity trends. In addition, the 2D surface reproduces the stretched exponential dynamics that we fit to the glucose solution experimental data at short times. Nonexponential dynamics at <10 micros is a signature either for local free energy minima along the reaction coordinate ("longitudinal roughness"), or for folding on a higher-dimensional free energy surface ("transverse roughness").},

abstract = {The large size of spectrin, the flexible protein promoting reversible deformation of red cells, has been an obstacle to elucidating the molecular mechanism of its function. By studying cloned fragments of the repeating unit domain, we have found a correspondence between positions of selected spectrin repeats in a tetramer with their stabilities of folding. Six fragments consisting of two spectrin repeats were selected for study primarily on the basis of the predicted secondary structures of their linker regions. Fragments with a putatively helical linker were more stable to urea- and heat-induced unfolding than those with a putatively nonhelical linker. Two of the less stably folded fragments, human erythroid alpha-spectrin repeats 13 and 14 (HEalpha13,14) and human erythroid beta-spectrin repeats 8 and 9 (HEbeta8,9), are located opposite each other on antiparallel spectrin dimers. At least partial unfolding of these repeats under physiological conditions indicates that they may serve as a hinge. Also less stably folded, the fragment of human erythroid alpha-spectrin repeats 4 and 5 (HEalpha4,5) lies opposite the site of interaction between the partial repeats at the C- and N-terminal ends of beta- and alpha-spectrin, respectively, on the opposing dimer. More stably folded fragments, human erythroid alpha-spectrin repeats 1 and 2 (HEalpha1,2) and human erythroid alpha-spectrin repeats 2 and 3 (HEalpha2,3), lie nearly opposite each other on antiparallel spectrin dimers of a tetramer. These clusterings along the spectrin tetramer of repeats with similar stabilities of folding may have relevance for spectrin function, particularly for its well known flexibility.},

abstract = {As in the case of many ligand-gated ion channels, the biochemical and electrophysiological properties of the ionotropic glutamate receptors have been studied extensively. Nevertheless, we still do not understand the molecular mechanisms that harness the free energy of agonist binding, first to drive channel opening, and then to allow the channel to close (desensitize) even though agonist remains bound. Recent crystallographic analyses of the ligand-binding domains of these receptors have identified conformational changes associated with agonist binding, yielding a working hypothesis of channel function. This opens the way to determining how the domains and subunits are assembled into an oligomeric channel, how the domains are connected, how the channel is formed, and where it is located relative to the ligand-binding domains, all of which govern the processes of channel activation and desensitization.},

A new multiscale model is developed here that clearly demonstrates the fashion in which planetary-scale circulations sharing many features in common with the observational record for the TIO are generated on intraseasonal time scales through the upscale transfer of kinetic and thermal energy generated by wave trains of organized synoptic-scale circulations having features in common with observed superclusters. The appeal of the multiscale models developed below is their firm mathematical underpinnings, simplicity, and analytic tractability while remaining self-consistent with key features of the observational record. The results below demonstrate, in a transparent fashion, the central role of organized vertically tilted synoptic-scale circulations in generating a planetary circulation resembling the TIO.},

abstract = {Conformational rearrangements in biomolecules (such as protein folding or enzyme-ligand binding) are often interpreted in terms of low-dimensional models of barrier crossing such as Kramers' theory. Dimensionality reduction, however, entails memory effects; as a result, the effective frictional drag force along the reaction coordinate nontrivially depends on the time scale of the transition. Moreover, when both solvent and "internal" friction effects are important, their interplay results in a highly nonlinear dependence of the effective friction on solvent viscosity that is not captured by common phenomenological models of barrier crossing. Here, these effects are illustrated using an analytically solvable toy model of an unstructured polymer chain involved in an inter- or intramolecular transition. The transition rate is calculated using the Grote-Hynes and Langer theories, which--unlike Kramers' theory--account for memory. The resulting effective frictional force exerted by the polymer along the reaction coordinate can be rationalized in terms of the effective number of monomers engaged in the transition. Faster transitions (relative to the polymer reconfiguration time scale) involve fewer monomers and, correspondingly, lower friction forces, because the polymer chain does not have enough time to reconfigure in response to the transition.},

abstract = {The accumulation of abnormal tau filaments is a pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. In 1998, genetic analyses revealed a direct linkage between structural and regulatory mutations in the tau gene and the neurodegenerative disease, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). Importantly, the FTDP-17 phenotype is transmitted in a dominant rather than a recessive manner. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms causing disease remain uncertain. The most common molecular mechanism generating dominant phenotypes is the loss of function of a multimeric complex containing both mutant and wild-type subunits. Therefore, we sought to determine whether tau might normally function as a multimer. We co-incubated 35S-radiolabeled tau and biotinylated tau with taxol stabilized microtubules, at very low molar ratios of tau to tubulin. Subsequent covalent cross-linking followed by affinity-precipitation of the biotinylated tau revealed the formation of microtubule-dependent tau oligomers. We next used atomic force microscopy to independently assess this conclusion. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that tau forms oligomers upon binding to microtubules. In addition to providing insights into normal tau action, our findings lead us to propose that one mechanism by which mutations in tau may cause cell death is through the formation of tau complexes containing mutant tau molecules in association with wild-type tau. These wild-type-mutant tau complexes may possess altered biological and/or biophysical properties that promote onset of the FTDP-17 phenotype, including neuronal cell death by either altering normal tau-mediated regulation of microtubule-dependent cellular functions and/or promoting the formation of pathological tau aggregates.},

abstract = {Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate much of the fast excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. The extracellular ligand binding core (S1S2) of the GluR2 subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors can be produced as a soluble protein with properties essentially identical to the corresponding domain in the intact, membrane-bound protein. Using a variety of biophysical techniques, much has been learned about the structure and dynamics of S1S2 and the relationship between its ligand-induced conformational changes and the function of the receptor. It is clear that dynamic processes are essential to the function of ionotropic glutamate receptors. We have isotopically labeled side chain methyls of GluR2 S1S2 and used NMR spectroscopy to study their dynamics on the ps-ns and mus-ms time scales. Increased disorder is seen in regions that are part of the key dimer interface in the intact protein. When glutamate is bound, the degree of ps-ns motion is less than that observed with other ligands, suggesting that the physiological agonist binds to a preformed binding site. At the slower time scales, the degree of S1S2 flexibility induced by ligand binding is greatest for willardiine partial agonists, least for antagonists, and intermediate for full agonists. Notable differences among bound ligands are in the region of the protein that forms a hinge between two lobes that close upon agonist binding, and along the beta-sheet in Lobe 2. These motions provide clues as to the functional properties of partial agonists and to the conformational changes associated with lobe closure and channel activation.},

These data include intraresidue and sequential H(N) − H($\alpha$) and H(N) − H(N) NOEs, values for (3) JHNH$\alpha$, (1) JH$\alpha$C$\alpha$, (2) JC$\alpha$N, and (1) JC$\alpha$N, as well as chemical shifts of (15)N, (13)C($\alpha$), and (13)C' nuclei, which are sensitive to backbone torsion angles. Distributions of these torsion angles were identified that yield best agreement to the experimental data, while using an entropy term to minimize the deviation from statistical distributions seen in a large protein coil library. Results indicate that although at the individual residue level considerable deviations from the coil library distribution are seen, on average the fitted distributions agree fairly well with this library, yielding a moderate population (20-30\%) of the PPII region and a somewhat higher population of the potentially aggregation-prone $\beta$ region (20-40\%) than seen in the database. A generally lower population of the $\alpha$R region (10-20\%) is found.

A system of 24 polyglutamine chains 16 residues long at a concentration of 5 mM spontaneously formed large beta sheets which curved to form tube-like annular structures that resemble beta barrels. This work was accomplished by extending the PRIME model to polyglutamine. PRIME is an off-lattice, unbiased, intermediate-resolution protein model based on an amino acid representation of between three and seven united atoms depending on the residue being modeled. Our results are interesting not only because of the recent discovery of tubular protofibrils in experiments on aggregation of mutant huntingtin fragments containing expanded polyglutamine tracts but also because Perutz predicted that polyglutamine forms water filled nanotubes.},

abstract = {The pathological manifestation of nine hereditary neurodegenerative diseases is the presence within the brain of aggregates of disease-specific proteins that contain polyglutamine tracts longer than a critical length. To improve our understanding of the processes by which polyglutamine-containing proteins misfold and aggregate, we have conducted molecular dynamics simulations of the aggregation of model polyglutamine peptides. This work was accomplished by extending the PRIME model to polyglutamine. PRIME is an off-lattice, unbiased, intermediate-resolution protein model based on an amino acid representation of between three and seven united atoms, depending on the residue being modeled. The effects of hydrophobicity on the system are studied by varying the strength of the hydrophobic interaction from 12.5\% to 5\% of the hydrogen-bonding interaction strength. In our simulations, we observe the spontaneous formation of aggregates and annular structures that are made up of beta-sheets starting from random configurations of random coils. This result was interesting because tubular protofibrils were recently found in experiments on polyglutamine aggregation and because of Perutz's prediction that polyglutamine would form water-filled nanotubes.},

abstract = {The evolutionary trajectory of a protein through sequence space is constrained by its function. Collections of sequence homologs record the outcomes of millions of evolutionary experiments in which the protein evolves according to these constraints. Deciphering the evolutionary record held in these sequences and exploiting it for predictive and engineering purposes presents a formidable challenge. The potential benefit of solving this challenge is amplified by the advent of inexpensive high-throughput genomic sequencing.In this paper we ask whether we can infer evolutionary constraints from a set of sequence homologs of a protein. The challenge is to distinguish true co-evolution couplings from the noisy set of observed correlations. We address this challenge using a maximum entropy model of the protein sequence, constrained by the statistics of the multiple sequence alignment, to infer residue pair couplings. Surprisingly, we find that the strength of these inferred couplings is an excellent predictor of residue-residue proximity in folded structures. Indeed, the top-scoring residue couplings are sufficiently accurate and well-distributed to define the 3D protein fold with remarkable accuracy.We quantify this observation by computing, from sequence alone, all-atom 3D structures of fifteen test proteins from different fold classes, ranging in size from 50 to 260 residues, including a G-protein coupled receptor. These blinded inferences are de novo, i.e., they do not use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The co-evolution signals provide sufficient information to determine accurate 3D protein structure to 2.7-4.8 \AA C($\alpha$)-RMSD error relative to the observed structure, over at least two-thirds of the protein (method called EVfold, details at http://EVfold.org). This discovery provides insight into essential interactions constraining protein evolution and will facilitate a comprehensive survey of the universe of protein structures, new strategies in protein and drug design, and the identification of functional genetic variants in normal and disease genomes.},

This information can be efficiently mined to detect evolutionary couplings between residues in proteins and address the long-standing challenge to compute protein three-dimensional structures from amino acid sequences. Substantial progress has recently been made on this problem owing to the explosive growth in available sequences and the application of global statistical methods. In addition to three-dimensional structure, the improved understanding of covariation may help identify functional residues involved in ligand binding, protein-complex formation and conformational changes. We expect computation of covariation patterns to complement experimental structural biology in elucidating the full spectrum of protein structures, their functional interactions and evolutionary dynamics.},

abstract = {An extended accelerated molecular dynamics (AMD) methodology called adaptive AMD is presented. Adaptive AMD (Ad-AMD) is an efficient and robust conformational space sampling algorithm that is particularly-well suited to proteins with highly structured potential energy surfaces exhibiting complex, large-scale collective conformational transitions. Ad-AMD simulations of substrate-free P450cam reveal that this system exists in equilibrium between a fully and partially open conformational state. The mechanism for substrate binding depends on the size of the ligand. Larger ligands enter the P450cam binding pocket, and the resulting substrate-bound system is trapped in an open conformation via a population shift mechanism. Small ligands, which fully enter the binding pocket, cause an induced-fit mechanism, resulting in the formation of an energetically stable closed conformational state. These results are corroborated by recent experimental studies and potentially provide detailed insight into the functional dynamics and conformational behavior of the entire cytochrome-P450 superfamily.},

Among these are changes in protein conformational entropy, which cannot yet be reliably computed from molecular structures. We have recently used changes in conformational dynamics as a proxy for changes in conformational entropy of calmodulin upon association with domains from regulated proteins. The apparent change in conformational entropy was linearly related to the overall binding entropy. This view warrants a more quantitative foundation. Here we calibrate an 'entropy meter' using an experimental dynamical proxy based on NMR relaxation and show that changes in the conformational entropy of calmodulin are a significant component of the energetics of binding. Furthermore, the distribution of motion at the interface between the target domain and calmodulin is surprisingly noncomplementary. These observations promote modification of our understanding of the energetics of protein-ligand interactions.},

One therapy for type 2 diabetes, glyburide, suppressed IAPP-mediated IL-1$\beta$ production in vitro. Processing of IL-1$\beta$ initiated by IAPP first required priming, a process that involved glucose metabolism and was facilitated by minimally oxidized low-density lipoprotein. Finally, mice transgenic for human IAPP had more IL-1$\beta$ in pancreatic islets, which localized together with amyloid and macrophages. Our findings identify previously unknown mechanisms in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and treatment of pathology caused by IAPP.},

abstract = {Upon cooling, water freezes to ice. This familiar phase transition occurs widely in nature, yet unlike the freezing of simple liquids, it has never been successfully simulated on a computer. The difficulty lies with the fact that hydrogen bonding between individual water molecules yields a disordered three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network whose rugged and complex global potential energy surface permits a large number of possible network configurations. As a result, it is very challenging to reproduce the freezing of 'real' water into a solid with a unique crystalline structure. For systems with a limited number of possible disordered hydrogen-bond network structures, such as confined water, it is relatively easy to locate a pathway from a liquid state to a crystalline structure. For pure and spatially unconfined water, however, molecular dynamics simulations of freezing are severely hampered by the large number of possible network configurations that exist. Here we present a molecular dynamics trajectory that captures the molecular processes involved in the freezing of pure water. We find that ice nucleation occurs once a sufficient number of relatively long-lived hydrogen bonds develop spontaneously at the same location to form a fairly compact initial nucleus. The initial nucleus then slowly changes shape and size until it reaches a stage that allows rapid expansion, resulting in crystallization of the entire system.},

abstract = {The structure of alpha-helix 1 (residues 6-18) in the transition state for the unfolding of barnase has been previously characterized by comparing the kinetics and thermodynamics of folding of wild-type protein with those of mutants whose side chains have been cut back, in the main, to that of alanine. The structure of the transition state has now been explored further by comparing the kinetics and thermodynamics of folding of glycine mutants with those of the alanine mutants at solvent-exposed positions in the alpha-helices of barnase. Such "Ala-->Gly scanning" provides a general procedure for examining the structure of solvent-exposed regions in the transition state. A gradual change of structure of the transition state was detected as helix 1 becomes increasingly destabilized on mutation. The extent of change of structure of helix 1 in the transition state for the mutant proteins was probed by a further round of Ala-->Gly scanning of those mutants. Destabilization of the helix 1 was found to cause the overall transition state for unfolding to become closer in structure to that of the folded protein. This is analogous to the conventional Hammond effect in physical-organic chemistry whereby the transition state moves parallel to the reaction coordinate with change in structure. But, paradoxically, the structure of helix 1 itself becomes less folded in the transition state as helix 1 becomes destabilized. This is analogous, however, to the rarer anti-Hammond effect in which there is movement perpendicular to the reaction coordinate. These observations are rationalized by plotting correlation diagrams of degree of formation of individual elements of structure against the degree of formation of overall structure in the transition state. There is a relatively smooth movement of the degree of compactness in the transition state against changes in activation energy on mutation that suggests a smooth movement of the transition state along the energy surface on mutation rather than a switch between two different parallel pathways. The results are consistent with the transition state having closely spaced energy levels. Helix 1, which appears to be an initiation point and forms early in the folding of wild-type protein, may be radically destabilized to the extent that it forms late in the folding of mutants. The order of events in folding may thus not be crucial.},

We present a new methodology that allows to combine the complementary strengths of theory and experiment for a more complete characterization of a protein folding landscape. We prove that this new procedure allows a simplified protein model to reproduce remarkably well (correlation coefficient > 0.9) all experimental data available on free energies differences upon single mutations for S6 ribosomal protein and two circular permutants. Our results confirm and quantify the hypothesis, recently formulated on the basis of experimental data, that the folding landscape of protein S6 is strongly affected by an atypical distribution of contact energies.},

abstract = {The detailed characterization of the overall free energy landscape associated with the folding process of a protein is the ultimate goal in protein folding studies. Modern experimental techniques and all-atom simulations provide a way to obtain accurate thermodynamic and kinetic measurements, but they are oftentimes restricted to probe limited regions of a protein landscape. Although simplified protein models can access larger regions of the landscape, they are built on assumptions and approximations that can affect the accuracy of the results. We review here recent promising approaches that allow to combine the complementary strengths of theory and experiment for a more complete characterization of a protein folding landscape at multiple resolutions. Recent results and possible applications are discussed.},

abstract = {We propose a realistic coarse-grained protein model and a technique to "anchor" the model to available experimental data. We apply this procedure to characterize the effect of multiple mutations on the folding mechanism of protein S6. We show that the mutation of a few "gatekeeper" residues triggers significant changes on the folding landscape of S6. These results suggest that gatekeeper residues control the flexibility of critical regions of S6, that in turn regulates the delicate balance between folding and aggregation. Although obtained with a minimalist protein model, these results are fully consistent with experimental evidence and offer a clue to understand the interplay between folding and aggregation in protein S6.},

abstract = {We present a dual-resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of liquid water employing a recently introduced Adaptive Resolution Scheme (AdResS). The spatially adaptive molecular resolution procedure allows for changing from a coarse-grained to an all-atom representation and vice versa on-the-fly. In order to find the most appropriate coarse-grained water model to be employed with AdResS, we first study the accuracy of different coarse-grained water models in reproducing the structural properties of the all-atom system. Typically, coarse-grained molecular models have a higher diffusion constant than the corresponding all-atom models due to the reduction in degrees of freedom (DOFs) upon coarse-graining that eliminates the fluctuating forces associated with those integrated-out molecular DOFs. Here, we introduce the methodology to obtain the same diffusional dynamics across different resolutions. We show that this approach leads to the correct description of the here relevant structural, thermodynamical, and dynamical properties, i.e., radial distribution functions, pressure, temperature, and diffusion, of liquid water at ambient conditions.},

Further, amyloid function depends entirely on a high intrinsic degree of order. Here we experimentally explored the sequence space of amyloid hexapeptides and used the derived data to build Waltz, a web-based tool that uses a position-specific scoring matrix to determine amyloid-forming sequences. Waltz allows users to identify and better distinguish between amyloid sequences and amorphous $\beta$-sheet aggregates and allowed us to identify amyloid-forming regions in functional amyloids.},

Distinct from other neurotransmitter receptors, the extracellular domains of iGluRs are loosely packed assemblies with two clearly distinct layers, each of which has both local and global 2-fold axes of symmetry. By contrast, the iGluR transmembrane segments have 4-fold symmetry and share a conserved pore loop architecture found in tetrameric voltage-gated ion channels. The striking layered architecture of iGluRs revealed by the 3.6 \AA resolution structure of an AMPA receptor homotetramer likely arose from gene fusion events that occurred early in evolution. Although this modular design has greatly facilitated biophysical and structural studies on individual iGluR domains, and suggested conserved mechanisms for iGluR gating, recent work is beginning to reveal unanticipated diversity in the structure, allosteric regulation, and assembly of iGluR subtypes.},

abstract = {Allostery describes altered protein function at one site due to a perturbation at another site. One mechanism of allostery involves correlated motions, which can occur even in the absence of substantial conformational change. We present a novel method, "MutInf", to identify statistically significant correlated motions from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach analyzes both backbone and sidechain motions using internal coordinates to account for the gear-like twists that can take place even in the absence of the large conformational changes typical of traditional allosteric proteins. We quantify correlated motions using a mutual information metric, which we extend to incorporate data from multiple short simulations and to filter out correlations that are not statistically significant. Applying our approach to uncover mechanisms of cooperative small molecule binding in human interleukin-2, we identify clusters of correlated residues from 50 ns of molecular dynamics simulations. Interestingly, two of the clusters with the strongest correlations highlight known cooperative small-molecule binding sites and show substantial correlations between these sites. These cooperative binding sites on interleukin-2 are correlated not only through the hydrophobic core of the protein but also through a dynamic polar network of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. Since this approach identifies correlated conformations in an unbiased, statistically robust manner, it should be a useful tool for finding novel or "orphan" allosteric sites in proteins of biological and therapeutic importance.},

abstract = {Statistical analysis of protein evolution suggests a design for natural proteins in which sparse networks of coevolving amino acids (termed sectors) comprise the essence of three-dimensional structure and function. However, proteins are also subject to pressures deriving from the dynamics of the evolutionary process itself--the ability to tolerate mutation and to be adaptive to changing selection pressures. To understand the relationship of the sector architecture to these properties, we developed a high-throughput quantitative method for a comprehensive single-mutation study in which every position is substituted individually to every other amino acid. Using a PDZ domain (PSD95(pdz3)) model system, we show that sector positions are functionally sensitive to mutation, whereas non-sector positions are more tolerant to substitution. In addition, we find that adaptation to a new binding specificity initiates exclusively through variation within sector residues. A combination of just two sector mutations located near and away from the ligand-binding site suffices to switch the binding specificity of PSD95(pdz3) quantitatively towards a class-switching ligand. The localization of functional constraint and adaptive variation within the sector has important implications for understanding and engineering proteins.},

abstract = {Modeling protein flexibility constitutes a major challenge in accurate prediction of protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions in docking simulations. The lack of a reliable method for predicting the conformational changes relevant to substrate binding prevents the productive application of computational docking to proteins that undergo large structural rearrangements. Here, we examine how coarse-grained normal mode analysis has been advantageously applied to modeling protein flexibility associated with ligand binding. First, we highlight recent studies that have shown that there is a close agreement between the large-scale collective motions of proteins predicted by elastic network models and the structural changes experimentally observed upon ligand binding. Then, we discuss studies that have exploited the predicted soft modes in docking simulations. Two general strategies are noted: pregeneration of conformational ensembles that are then utilized as input for standard fixed-backbone docking and protein structure deformation along normal modes concurrent to docking. These studies show that the structural changes apparently "induced" upon ligand binding occur selectively along the soft modes accessible to the protein prior to ligand binding. They further suggest that proteins offer suitable means of accommodating/facilitating the recognition and binding of their ligand, presumably acquired by evolutionary selection of the suitable three-dimensional structure.},

abstract = {Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) are specific proteins that are able to lower the freezing point of aqueous solutions relative to the melting point. Hyperactive AFPs, identified in insects, have an especially high ability to depress the freezing point by far exceeding the abilities of other AFPs. In previous studies, we postulated that the activity of AFPs can be attributed to two distinct molecular mechanisms: (i) short-range direct interaction of the protein surface with the growing ice face and (ii) long-range interaction by protein-induced water dynamics extending up to 20 \AA from the protein surface. In the present paper, we combine terahertz spectroscopy and molecular simulations to prove that long-range protein-water interactions make essential contributions to the high antifreeze activity of insect AFPs from the beetle Dendroides canadensis. We also support our hypothesis by studying the effect of the addition of the osmolyte sodium citrate.},

abstract = {Energy landscapes have been used to conceptually describe and model protein folding but have been difficult to measure experimentally, in large part because of the myriad of partly folded protein conformations that cannot be isolated and thermodynamically characterized. Here we experimentally determine a detailed energy landscape for protein folding. We generated a series of overlapping constructs containing subsets of the seven ankyrin repeats of the Drosophila Notch receptor, a protein domain whose linear arrangement of modular structural units can be fragmented without disrupting structure. To a good approximation, stabilities of each construct can be described as a sum of energy terms associated with each repeat. The magnitude of each energy term indicates that each repeat is intrinsically unstable but is strongly stabilized by interactions with its nearest neighbors. These linear energy terms define an equilibrium free energy landscape, which shows an early free energy barrier and suggests preferred low-energy routes for folding.},

abstract = {To obtain quantitative information on the size and dynamics of unfolded proteins we combined single-molecule lifetime and intensity FRET measurements with molecular simulations. We compared the unfolded states of the 64-residue, alpha/beta protein L and the 66-residue, all-beta cold-shock protein CspTm. The average radius of gyration (Rg) calculated from FRET data on freely diffusing molecules was identical for the two unfolded proteins at guanidinium chloride concentrations >3 M, and the FRET-derived Rg of protein L agreed well with the Rg previously measured by equilibrium small-angle x-ray scattering. As the denaturant concentration was lowered, the mean FRET efficiency of the unfolded subpopulation increased, signaling collapse of the polypeptide chain, with protein L being slightly more compact than CspTm. A decrease in Rg with decreasing denaturant was also observed in all-atom molecular dynamics calculations in explicit water/urea solvent, and Langevin simulations of a simplified representation of the polypeptide suggest that collapse can result from either increased interresidue attraction or decreased excluded volume. In contrast to both the FRET and simulation results, previous time-resolved small-angle x-ray scattering experiments showed no collapse for protein L. Analysis of the donor fluorescence decay of the unfolded subpopulation of both proteins gives information about the end-to-end chain distribution and suggests that chain dynamics is slow compared with the donor life-time of approximately 2 ns, whereas the bin-size independence of the small excess width above the shot noise for the FRET efficiency distributions may result from incomplete conformational averaging on even the 1-ms time scale.},

@article{Meszaros2007,
abstract = {Thorough knowledge of the molecular principles of protein-protein recognition is essential to our understanding of protein function at the cellular level. Whereas interactions of ordered proteins have been analyzed in great detail, complexes of intrinsically unstructured/disordered proteins (IUPs) have hardly been addressed so far. Here, we have collected a database of 39 complexes of experimentally verified IUPs, and compared their interfaces with those of 72 complexes of ordered, globular proteins. The characteristic differences found between the two types of complexes suggest that IUPs represent a distinct molecular implementation of the principles of protein-protein recognition. The interfaces do not differ in size, but those of IUPs cover a much larger part of the surface of the protein than for their ordered counterparts. Moreover, IUP interfaces are significantly more hydrophobic relative to their overall amino acid composition, but also in absolute terms. They rely more on hydrophobic-hydrophobic than on polar-polar interactions. Their amino acids in the interface realize more intermolecular contacts, which suggests a better fit with the partner due to induced folding upon binding that results in a better adaptation to the partner. The two modes of interaction also differ in that IUPs usually use only a single continuous segment for partner binding, whereas the binding sites of ordered proteins are more segmented. Probably, all these features contribute to the increased evolutionary conservation of IUP interface residues. These noted molecular differences are also manifested in the interaction energies of IUPs. Our approximation of these by low-resolution force-fields shows that IUPs gain much more stabilization energy from intermolecular contacts, than from folding, i.e. they use their binding energy for folding. Overall, our findings provide a structural rationale to the prior suggestions that many IUPs are specialized for functions realized by protein-protein interactions.},

@article{Mey2014,
abstract = {Computing the equilibrium properties of complex systems, such as free energy differences, is often hampered by rare events in the dynamics. Enhanced sampling methods may be used in order to speed up sampling by, for example, using high temperatures, as in parallel tempering; or simulating with a biasing potential such as in the case of umbrella sampling. The equilibrium properties of the thermodynamic state of interest (e.g. lowest temperature or unbiased potential) can be computed using reweighting estimators such as the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) or the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR). WHAM and MBAR produce unbiased estimates, the simulation samples from the global equilibria at their respective thermodynamic states - a requirement that can be a prohibitively expensive for some simulations such as a large parallel tempering ensemble of an explicitly solvated biomolecule. Here we introduce the Transition-based Reweighting Analysis Method (TRAM) - a class of estimators that exploits ideas from Markov modeling and only require the simulation data to be in local equilibrium within subsets of the configuration space. We formulate the expanded TRAM (xTRAM) estimator that is shown to be asymptotically unbiased and a generalization of MBAR. Using four exemplary systems of varying complexity, we demonstrate the improved convergence (ranging from a two fold improvement to several orders of magnitude) of xTRAM in comparison to a direct counting estimator and MBAR, with respect to the invested simulation effort. Lastly, we introduce a random swapping simulation protocol that can be used with xTRAM gaining orders of magnitude advantages over simulation protocols that require the constraint of sampling from a global equilibrium.},

abstract = {For several years following the discovery and characterization of the first PYP, from Halorhodospira halophila, it was thought that this photoactive protein was quite unique, notwithstanding the isolation of two additional examples in rapid succession. Mainly because of genomic and metagenomic analyses, we have now learned that more than 140 PYP genes occur in a wide variety of bacteria and metabolic niches although the protein has not been isolated in most cases. The amino acid sequences and physical properties permit their organization into at least seven groups that are also likely to be functionally distinct. Based upon action spectra and the wavelength of maximum absorbance, it was speculated nearly 20 years ago but never proven that Hr. halophila PYP was involved in phototaxis. Nevertheless, in only one instance has the functional role and interaction partner for a PYP been experimentally proven, in Rs. centenum Ppr. Genetic context is one of several types of evidence indicating that PYP is potentially involved in a number of diverse functional roles. The interaction with other sensors to modulate their activity stands out as the single most prominent role for PYP. In this review, we have attempted to summarize the evidence for the functional roles and interaction partners for some 26 of the 35 named species of PYP, which should be considered the basis for further focused molecular and biochemical research.},

What is the number of sequences that fold into a particular protein structure? Is it possible to switch between stable protein folds by point mutations? To address these questions, we compute a directed graph of sequences and structures of proteins, which is based on 2,060 experimentally determined protein shapes from the Protein Data Bank. The directed graph is highly connected at native energies with "sinks" that attract many sequences from other folds. The sinks are rich in beta-sheets. The number of sequences that transition between folds is significantly smaller than the number of sequences retained by their fold. The sequence flow into a particular protein shape from other proteins correlates with the number of sequences that matches this shape in empirically determined genomes. Properties of strongly connected components of the graph are correlated with protein length and secondary structure.},

@article{Michnick1998,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nucleation-growth theory predicts that fast-folding peptide sequences fold to their native structure via structures in a transition-state ensemble that share a small number of native contacts (the folding nucleus). Experimental and theoretical studies of proteins suggest that residues participating in folding nuclei are conserved among homologs. We attempted to determine if this is true in proteins with highly diverged sequences but identical folds (superfamilies).

RESULTS: We describe a strategy based on comparisons of residue conservation in natural superfamily sequences with simulated sequences (generated with a Monte-Carlo sequence design strategy) for the same proteins. The basic assumptions of the strategy were that natural sequences will conserve residues needed for folding and stability plus function, the simulated sequences contain no functional conservation, and nucleus residues make native contacts with each other. Based on these assumptions, we identified seven potential nucleus residues in ubiquitin superfamily members. Non-nucleus conserved residues were also identified; these are proposed to be involved in stabilizing native interactions. We found that all superfamily members conserved the same potential nucleus residue positions, except those for which the structural topology is significantly different.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the conservation of the nucleus of a specific fold can be predicted by comparing designed simulated sequences with natural highly diverged sequences that fold to the same structure. We suggest that such a strategy could be used to help plan protein folding and design experiments, to identify new superfamily members, and to subdivide superfamilies further into classes having a similar folding mechanism.},

abstract = {We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of histone modifications in mammalian cells. By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of mouse embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts. We find that lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation effectively discriminates genes that are expressed, poised for expression, or stably repressed, and therefore reflect cell state and lineage potential. Lysine 36 trimethylation marks primary coding and non-coding transcripts, facilitating gene annotation. Trimethylation of lysine 9 and lysine 20 is detected at satellite, telomeric and active long-terminal repeats, and can spread into proximal unique sequences. Lysine 4 and lysine 9 trimethylation marks imprinting control regions. Finally, we show that chromatin state can be read in an allele-specific manner by using single nucleotide polymorphisms. This study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations.},

abstract = {Sequences of fast-folding model proteins (48 residues long on a cubic lattice) were generated by an evolution-like selection toward fast folding. We find that fast-folding proteins exhibit a specific folding mechanism in which all transition state conformations share a smaller subset of common contacts (folding nucleus). Acceleration of folding was accompanied by dramatic strengthening of interactions in the folding nucleus whereas average energy of nonnucleus interactions remained largely unchanged. Furthermore, the residues involved in the nucleus are the most conserved ones within families of evolved sequences. Our results imply that for each protein structure there is a small number of conserved positions that are key determinants of fast folding into that structure. This conjecture was tested on two protein superfamilies: the first having the classical monophosphate binding fold (CMBF; 98 families) and the second having type-III repeat fold (47 families). For each superfamily, we discovered a few positions that exhibit very strong and statistically significant "conservatism of conservatism"-amino acids in those positions are conserved within every family whereas the actual types of amino acids varied from family to family. Those amino acids are in spatial contact with each other. The experimental data of Serrano and coworkers [Lopez-Hernandez, E. \& Serrano, L. (1996) Fold. Des. (London) 1, 43-55]. for one of the proteins of the CMBF superfamily (CheY) show that residues identified this way indeed belong to the folding nucleus. Further analysis revealed deep connections between nucleation in CMBF proteins and their function.},

abstract = {Here, we provide an analysis of molecular evolution of five of the most populated protein folds: immunoglobulin fold, oligonucleotide-binding fold, Rossman fold, alpha/beta plait, and TIM barrels. In order to distinguish between "historic", functional and structural reasons for amino acid conservations, we consider proteins that acquire the same fold and have no evident sequence homology. For each fold we identify positions that are conserved within each individual family and coincide when non-homologous proteins are structurally superimposed. As a baseline for statistical assessment we use the conservatism expected based on the solvent accessibility. The analysis is based on a new concept of "conservatism-of-conservatism". This approach allows us to identify the structural features that are stabilized in all proteins having a given fold, despite the fact that actual interactions that provide such stabilization may vary from protein to protein. Comparison with experimental data on thermodynamics, folding kinetics and function of the proteins reveals that such universally conserved clusters correspond to either: (i) super-sites (common location of active site in proteins having common tertiary structures but not function) or (ii) folding nuclei whose stability is an important determinant of folding rate, or both (in the case of Rossman fold). The analysis also helps to clarify the relation between folding and function that is apparent for some folds.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce a novel method of deriving a pairwise potential for protein folding. The potential is obtained by an optimization procedure that simultaneously maximizes thermodynamic stability for all proteins in the database. When applied to the representative dataset of proteins and with the energy function taken in pairwise contact approximation, our potential scored somewhat better than existing ones. However, the discrimination of the native structure from decoys is still not strong enough to make the potential useful for ab initio folding. Our results suggest that the problem lies with pairwise amino acid contact approximation and/or simplified presentation of proteins rather than with the derivation of potential. We argue that more detail of protein structure and energetics should be taken into account to achieve energy gaps. The suggested method is general enough to allow us to systematically derive parameters for more sophisticated energy functions. The internal control of validity for the potential derived by our method is convergence to a unique solution upon addition of new proteins to the database. The method is tested on simple model systems where sequences are designed, using the preset "true" potential, to have low energy in a dataset of structures. Our procedure is able to recover the potential with correlation r approximately 91\% with the true one and we were able to fold all model structures using the recovered potential. Other statistical knowledge-based approaches were tested using this model and the results indicate that they also can recover the true potential with high degree of accuracy.},

Two aspects of our study are especially important: (i) grouping of amino acid residues into classes according to their physical-chemical properties and (ii) proper normalization of amino acid probabilities that reflects the fact that evolutionary pressure to conserve some amino acid types may itself affect concentration of various amino acid types in protein families.

abstract = {Understanding the effects of confinement on protein stability and folding kinetics is important for describing protein folding in the cellular environment. We have investigated the effects of confinement on two structurally distinct proteins as a function of the dimension d(c) and characteristic size R of the confining boundary. We find that the stabilization of the folded state relative to bulk conditions is quantitatively described by R(-gamma(c)), where the exponent gamma(c) is approximately 5/3 independent of the dimension of confinement d(c) (cylindrical, planar, or spherical). Moreover, we find that the logarithm of the folding rates also scale as R(-gamma(c)), with deviations only being seen for very small confining geometries, where folding is downhill; for both stability and kinetics, the dominant effect is the change in the free energy of the unfolded state. A secondary effect on the kinetics is a slight destabilization of the transition state by confinement, although the contacts present in the confined transition state are essentially identical to the bulk case. We investigate the effect of confinement on the position-dependent diffusion coefficients D(Q) for dynamics along the reaction coordinate Q (fraction of native contacts). The diffusion coefficients only change in the unfolded state basin, where they are increased because of compaction.},

abstract = {Pairwise contact energies for 20 types of residues are estimated self-consistently from the actual observed frequencies of contacts with regression coefficients that are obtained by comparing "input" and predicted values with the Bethe approximation for the equilibrium mixtures of residues interacting. This is premised on the fact that correlations between the "input" and the predicted values are sufficiently high although the regression coefficients themselves can depend to some extent on protein structures as well as interaction strengths. Residue coordination numbers are optimized to obtain the best correlation between "input" and predicted values for the partition energies. The contact energies self-consistently estimated this way indicate that the partition energies predicted with the Bethe approximation should be reduced by a factor of about 0.3 and the intrinsic pairwise energies by a factor of about 0.6. The observed distribution of contacts can be approximated with a small relative error of only about 0.08 as an equilibrium mixture of residues, if many proteins were employed to collect more than 20,000 contacts. Including repulsive packing interactions and secondary structure interactions further reduces the relative errors. These new contact energies are demonstrated by threading to have improved their ability to discriminate native structures from other non-native folds.},

abstract = {Attractive inter-residue contact energies for proteins have been re-evaluated with the same assumptions and approximations used originally by us in 1985, but with a significantly larger set of protein crystal structures. An additional repulsive packing energy term, operative at higher densities to prevent overpacking, has also been estimated for all 20 amino acids as a function of the number of contacting residues, based on their observed distributions. The two terms of opposite sign are intended to be used together to provide an estimate of the overall energies of inter-residue interactions in simplified proteins without atomic details. To overcome the problem of how to utilize the many homologous proteins in the Protein Data Bank, a new scheme has been devised to assign different weights to each protein, based on similarities among amino acid sequences. A total of 1168 protein structures containing 1661 subunit sequences are actually used here. After the sequence weights have been applied, these correspond to an effective number of residue-residue contacts of 113,914, or about six times more than were used in the old analysis. Remarkably, the new attractive contact energies are nearly identical to the old ones, except for those with Leu and the rarer amino acids Trp and Met. The largest change found for Leu is surprising. The estimates of hydrophobicity from the contact energies for non-polar side-chains agree well with the experimental values. In an application of these contact energies, the sequences of 88 structurally distinct proteins in the Protein Data Bank are threaded at all possible positions without gaps into 189 different folds of proteins whose sequences differ from each other by at least 35\% sequence identity. The native structures for 73 of 88 proteins, excluding 15 exceptional proteins such as membrane proteins, are all demonstrated to have the lowest alignment energies.},

abstract = {We estimate the statistical distribution of relative orientations between contacting residues from a database of protein structures and evaluate the potential of mean force for relative orientations between contacting residues. Polar angles and Euler angles are used to specify two degrees of directional freedom and three degrees of rotational freedom for the orientation of one residue relative to another in contacting residues, respectively. A local coordinate system affixed to each residue based only on main chain atoms is defined for fold recognition. The number of contacting residue pairs in the database will severely limit the resolution of the statistical distribution of relative orientations, if it is estimated by dividing space into cells and counting samples observed in each cell. To overcome such problems and to evaluate the fully anisotropic distributions of relative orientations as a function of polar and Euler angles, we choose a method in which the observed distribution is represented as a sum of delta functions each of which represents the observed orientation of a contacting residue, and is evaluated as a series expansion of spherical harmonics functions. The sample size limits the frequencies of modes whose expansion coefficients can be reliably estimated. High frequency modes are statistically less reliable than low frequency modes. Each expansion coefficient is separately corrected for the sample size according to suggestions from a Bayesian statistical analysis. As a result, many expansion terms can be utilized to evaluate orientational distributions. Also, unlike other orientational potentials, the uniform distribution is used for a reference distribution in evaluating a potential of mean force for each type of contacting residue pair from its orientational distribution, so that residue-residue orientations can be fully evaluated. It is shown by using decoy sets that the discrimination power of the orientational potential in fold recognition increases by taking account of the Euler angle dependencies and becomes comparable to that of a simple contact potential, and that the total energy potential taken as a simple sum of contact, orientation, and (phi,psi) potentials performs well to identify the native folds.},

abstract = {The N-terminal SH3 domain of the Drosophila drk protein (drkN SH3) exists in equilibrium between folded and unfolded states under non-denaturing buffer conditions. In order to examine the origins of this instability, we have made mutations in the domain and characterized the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding. Results of substitutions of negatively charged residues to neutral amino acid residues suggest that the large electrostatic potential of the domain does not play a dominant role in the instability of the domain. Sequence alignment of a large number of SH3 domains reveals that the drkN SH3 domain has a threonine (T22) at a position corresponding to an otherwise highly conserved glycine residue in the diverging beta-turn connecting the beta3 and beta4 strands. Mutation of T22 to glycine results in significant stabilization of the drkN SH3 domain by 2.5 kcal/mole. To further characterize the basis for the stabilization of the T22 mutant relative to wild-type, we made additional mutant proteins with substitutions of residue T22. A strong correlation is seen between protein stability or folding rate and propensity for native beta-turn structure at this position. Correlation of folding rates with AGADIR predictions of non-native helical structure in the diverging turn region, along with our previous NMR evidence for non-native structure in this region of the unfolded state of the drkN SH3 domain, suggests that the free energy of the unfolded state also plays a role in stability. This result highlights the importance of both folded and unfolded states for understanding protein stability.},

abstract = {Water and silicon are chemically dissimilar substances with common physical properties. Their liquids display a temperature of maximum density, increased diffusivity on compression, and they form tetrahedral crystals and tetrahedral amorphous phases. The common feature to water, silicon, and carbon is the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated units. We exploit these similarities to develop a coarse-grained model of water (mW) that is essentially an atom with tetrahedrality intermediate between carbon and silicon. mW mimics the hydrogen-bonded structure of water through the introduction of a nonbond angular dependent term that encourages tetrahedral configurations. The model departs from the prevailing paradigm in water modeling: the use of long-ranged forces (electrostatics) to produce short-ranged (hydrogen-bonded) structure. mW has only short-range interactions yet it reproduces the energetics, density and structure of liquid water, and its anomalies and phase transitions with comparable or better accuracy than the most popular atomistic models of water, at less than 1\% of the computational cost. We conclude that it is not the nature of the interactions but the connectivity of the molecules that determines the structural and thermodynamic behavior of water. The speedup in computing time provided by mW makes it particularly useful for the study of slow processes in deeply supercooled water, the mechanism of ice nucleation, wetting-drying transitions, and as a realistic water model for coarse-grained simulations of biomolecules and complex materials.},

This includes not only proteins' native structures, but also all their respective functional states, including functionally important intermediates. Here, we reveal a signature of functionally important states in several protein families, using direct coupling analysis, which detects residue pair coevolution of protein sequence composition. This signature is exploited in a protein structure-based model to uncover conformational diversity, including hidden functional configurations. We uncovered, with high resolution (mean \~{}1.9 \AA rmsd for nonapo structures), different functional structural states for medium to large proteins (200-450 aa) belonging to several distinct families. The combination of direct coupling analysis and the structure-based model also predicts several intermediates or hidden states that are of functional importance. This enhanced sampling is broadly applicable and has direct implications in protein structure determination and the design of ligands or drugs to trap intermediate states.},

abstract = {The similarity in the three-dimensional structures of homologous proteins imposes strong constraints on their sequence variability. It has long been suggested that the resulting correlations among amino acid compositions at different sequence positions can be exploited to infer spatial contacts within the tertiary protein structure. Crucial to this inference is the ability to disentangle direct and indirect correlations, as accomplished by the recently introduced direct-coupling analysis (DCA). Here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of DCA, which allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by DCA for a large number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. DCA is shown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains examined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intradomain residue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations, ligand-mediated residue couplings, and interdomain interactions in protein oligomers. Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by DCA can be used as a reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of protein domain structures, contingent on the existence of a large number of homologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in genome sequencing.},

One such characteristic is the effective temperature Tsel at which these foldable sequences have been selected in sequence space by evolution. Tsel quantifies the importance of folded-state energetics and structural specificity for molecular evolution.

@article{Morrissey1996,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methods of model protein design have until now been largely ad hoc, yielding sequences that are foldable only at some seemingly arbitrary simulation temperature. But real proteins exist and must fold within an imposed thermal environment. The need exists for a sequence design method based on statistical-mechanical first principles, thus containing a rigorous treatment of folding temperature.

RESULTS: In this work, we report a method of rational sequence design that takes a target structure and a desired optimal folding temperature TZ and generates a sequence that is predicted to be thermodynamically stable with respect to the target structure at a folding temperature TF approximately TZ. This 'cumulant design method' is based on a mean-field high temperature expansion of the molecular partition function. Folding simulations of the designed sequences confirm that sequences designed at TZ do indeed fold optimally when TF approximately TZ.

CONCLUSIONS: The cumulant method is highly successful in designing model proteins. It also provides some insight into the thermal properties of real proteins, illuminating the features that distinguish thermostable and psychotropic (cold-loving) sequences from their mesophilic counterparts.},

abstract = {How stabilising non-native interactions influence protein folding energy landscapes is currently not well understood: such interactions could speed folding by reducing the conformational search to the native state, or could slow folding by increasing ruggedness. Here, we examine the influence of non-native interactions in the folding process of the bacterial immunity protein Im9, by exploiting our ability to manipulate the stability of the intermediate and rate-limiting transition state (TS) in the folding of this protein by minor alteration of its sequence or changes in solvent conditions. By analysing the properties of these species using Phi-value analysis, and exploration of the structural properties of the TS ensemble using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate the importance of non-native interactions in immunity protein folding and demonstrate that the rate-limiting step involves partial reorganisation of these interactions as the TS ensemble is traversed. Moreover, we show that increasing the contribution to stability made by non-native interactions results in an increase in Phi-values of the TS ensemble without altering its structural properties or solvent-accessible surface area. The data suggest that the immunity proteins fold on multiple, but closely related, micropathways, resulting in a heterogeneous TS ensemble that responds subtly to mutation or changes in the solvent conditions. Thus, altering the relative strength of native and non-native interactions influences the search to the native state by restricting the pathways through the folding energy landscape.},

We show that the monomeric and the domain swapped dimeric forms of the G55A mutant of Protein L are directly observable by solution NMR spectroscopy under equilibrium conditions. The kinetics of the domain swapping process can be characterized by real-time NMR spectroscopic techniques, and the free energy landscape for domain swapping of Protein L can be probed by variation of denaturant concentration. Our data suggest that domain swapping of Protein L proceeds through a compact transition state, with an accessible surface area that is similar in size to the transition state for folding and unfolding. It is thus conceivable that domain swapping and folding of Protein L are mechanistically related at the level of their rate-limiting step(s), which might represent a branching point along the folding pathway.},

Understanding the self-assembly mechanisms to control dimensions and shapes of the nanostructures remains a grand challenge. We report here on a systematic study of peptide amphiphiles containing valine?glutamic acid dimeric repeats known to promote self-assembly into belt-like flat assemblies. We find that the lateral growth of the assemblies can be controlled in the range of 100 nm down to 10 nm as the number of dimeric repeats is increased from two to six. Using circular dichroism, the degree of ?-sheet twisting within the supramolecular assemblies was found to be directly proportional to the number of dimeric repeats in the PA molecule. Interestingly, as twisting increased, a threshold is reached where cylinders rather than flat assemblies become the dominant morphology. We also show that in the belt regime, the width of the nanostructures can be decreased by raising the pH to increase charge density and therefore electrostatic repulsion among glutamic acid residues. The control of size and shape of these nanostructures should affect their functions in biological signaling and drug delivery.},

abstract = {Knowledge-based approaches frequently employ empirical relations to determine effective potentials for coarse-grained protein models directly from protein databank structures. Although these approaches have enjoyed considerable success and widespread popularity in computational protein science, their fundamental basis has been widely questioned. It is well established that conventional knowledge-based approaches do not correctly treat many-body correlations between amino acids. Moreover, the physical significance of potentials determined by using structural statistics from different proteins has remained obscure. In the present work, we address both of these concerns by introducing and demonstrating a theory for calculating transferable potentials directly from a databank of protein structures. This approach assumes that the databank structures correspond to representative configurations sampled from equilibrium solution ensembles for different proteins. Given this assumption, this physics-based theory exactly treats many-body structural correlations and directly determines the transferable potentials that provide a variationally optimized approximation to the free energy landscape for each protein. We illustrate this approach by first constructing a databank of protein structures using a model potential and then quantitatively recovering this potential from the structure databank. The proposed framework will clarify the assumptions and physical significance of knowledge-based potentials, allow for their systematic improvement, and provide new insight into many-body correlations and cooperativity in folded proteins.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) models provide a computationally efficient means for investigating phenomena that remain beyond the scope of atomically detailed models. Although CG models are often parametrized to reproduce the results of atomistic simulations, it is highly desirable to determine accurate CG models from experimental data. Recently, we have introduced a generalized Yvon-Born-Green (g-YBG) theory for directly (i.e., noniteratively) determining variationally optimized CG potentials from structural correlation functions. In principle, these correlation functions can be determined from experiment. In the present work, we introduce a reference state potential into the g-YBG framework. The reference state defines a fixed contribution to the CG potential. The remaining terms in the potential are then determined, such that the combined potential provides an optimal approximation to the many-body potential of mean force. By specifying a fixed contribution to the potential, the reference state significantly reduces the computational complexity and structural information necessary for determining the remaining potentials. We also validate the quantitative accuracy of the proposed method and numerically demonstrate that the reference state provides a convenient framework for transferring CG potentials from neat liquids to more complex systems. The resulting CG model provides a surprisingly accurate description of the two- and three-particle solvation structures of a hydrophobic solute in methanol. This work represents a significant step in developing the g-YBG theory as a useful computational framework for determining accurate CG models from limited experimental data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein stability appears to be governed by non-covalent interactions. These can be local (between residues close in sequence) or non-local (medium-range and long-range interactions). The specific role of local interactions is controversial. Statistical mechanics arguments point out that local interactions must be weak in stable folded proteins. However, site-directed mutagenesis has revealed that local interactions make a significant contribution to protein stability. Finally, computer simulations suggest that correctly folded proteins require a delicate balance between local and non-local contributions to protein stability.

RESULT: To analyze experimentally the effect of local interactions on protein stability, each of the five Che Y alpha-helices was enhanced in its helical propensity. alpha-Helix-promoting mutations have been designed, using a helix/coil transition algorithm tuned for heteropolypeptides, that do not alter the overall hydrophobicity or protein packing. The increase in helical propensity has been evaluated by far-UV CD analysis of the corresponding peptides. Thermodynamic analysis of the five Che Y mutants reveals, in all cases, an increase in half urea ([urea]1/2) and in Tm, and a decrease in the sensitivity to chemical denaturants (m). ANS binding assays indicate that the changes in m are not due to the stabilization of an intermediate, and the kinetic analysis of the mutants shows that their equilibrium unfolding transition can be considered as following a two-state model, while the change in m is found in the refolding reaction (m(k)f).

CONCLUSIONS: These results are explained by a variable two-state model in which the changes in half urea and Tm arise from the stabilization of the native state and the decrease in m from the compaction of the denatured state. Therefore, the net change in protein stability in aqueous solution produced by increasing the contribution of native-like local interactions in Che Y is the balance between these two conflicting effects. Our results support the idea that optimization of protein stability and cooperativity involve a specific ratio of local versus non-local interactions.},

abstract = {An elementary statistical mechanical model was used to calculate the folding rates for 22 proteins from their known three-dimensional structures. In this model, residues come into contact only after all of the intervening chain is in the native conformation. An additional simplifying assumption is that native structure grows from localized regions that then fuse to form the complete native molecule. The free energy function for this model contains just two contributions-conformational entropy of the backbone and the energy of the inter-residue contacts. The matrix of inter-residue interactions is obtained from the atomic coordinates of the three-dimensional structure. For the 18 proteins that exhibit two-state equilibrium and kinetic behavior, profiles of the free energy versus the number of native peptide bonds show two deep minima, corresponding to the native and denatured states. For four proteins known to exhibit intermediates in folding, the free energy profiles show additional deep minima. The calculated rates of folding the two-state proteins, obtained by solving a diffusion equation for motion on the free energy profiles, reproduce the experimentally determined values surprisingly well. The success of these calculations suggests that folding speed is largely determined by the distribution and strength of contacts in the native structure. We also calculated the effect of mutations on the folding kinetics of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2, the most intensively studied two-state protein, with some success.},

Here, we describe a simple statistical mechanical model for the formation of a beta-hairpin, the minimal structural element of the antiparallel beta-pleated sheet. The model accurately describes the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of a 16-residue, beta-hairpin-forming peptide, successfully explaining its two-state behavior and apparent negative activation energy for folding. The model classifies structures according to their backbone conformation, defined by 15 pairs of dihedral angles, and is further simplified by considering only the 120 structures with contiguous stretches of native pairs of backbone dihedral angles. This single sequence approximation is tested by comparison with a more complete model that includes the 2(15) possible conformations and 15 x 2(15) possible kinetic transitions. Finally, we use the model to predict the equilibrium unfolding curves and kinetics for several variants of the beta-hairpin peptide.},

This database, when implemented in an algorithm based on the helix-coil transition theory (AGADIR), correctly calculates the average helical behaviour in solution of 423 peptides analysed by circular dichroism. The majority of these peptides have been studied at low temperatures (0 to 10 degrees C), and neutral pH. However, in vivo, proteins fold at higher temperatures and in some cases low or high pH values. To understand protein folding it is necessary to calculate the helical behaviour of linear peptides under very different temperature and pH experimental conditions. We have included the temperature and pH effects on the helical behaviour of peptides by means of generally accepted assumptions and simplifications. The inclusion of these terms allow us to calculate the helical behaviour of polyalanine-based peptides, as well as of complex natural sequences, under different experimental conditions.},

The information about the conformational behaviour of helical peptides in solution, as well as the alpha-helix stability in proteins, has been utilised to derive a database with the energy contributions for various interaction taking place in an alpha-helix: intrinsic helical propensities, side-chain to side-chain interactions, main-chain to main-chain hydrogen bonds, and capping effects. This database was implemented in a algorithm based on the helix-coil transition theory (AGADIR). Here, the effects on helix stability due to interactions between charged groups and the helix macrodipole are described, quantified and implemented in AGADIR. The algorithm correctly calculates the average helical behaviour in solution of 423 peptides analysed by circular dichroism and it describes the helicity at a residue level, as found when comparing the prediction for each amino acid residue with the data derived from nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Using AGADIR we have done a rational modification of peptides corresponding to protein secondary structure elements in order to increase their helical content. The circular dichroism analysis of the mutant peptides showed a very good agreement between the experimental and calculated helical content. Moreover, in certain specific cases in which strong tertiary contacts in folded proteins do not exist, the algorithm successfully predicts the length of mutagenised alpha-helices. It is interesting to note that the final values of the parameters used do not significantly differ in absolute terms from those extracted from mutagenesis studies in proteins. This indicates that the same physico-chemical principles stand for both systems.},

abstract = {Protein chains coil into alpha-helices and beta-sheet structures. Knowing the timescales and mechanism of formation of these basic structural elements is essential for understanding how proteins fold. For the past 40 years, alpha-helix formation has been extensively investigated in synthetic and natural peptides, including by nanosecond kinetic studies. In contrast, the mechanism of formation of beta structures has not been studied experimentally. The minimal beta-structure element is the beta-hairpin, which is also the basic component of antiparallel beta-sheets. Here we use a nanosecond laser temperature-jump apparatus to study the kinetics of folding a beta-hairpin consisting of 16 amino-acid residues. Folding of the hairpin occurs in 6 micros at room temperature, which is about 30 times slower than the rate of alpha-helix formation. We have developed a simple statistical mechanical model that provides a structural explanation for this result. Our analysis also shows that folding of a beta-hairpin captures much of the basic physics of protein folding, including stabilization by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, two-state behaviour, and a funnel-like, partially rugged energy landscape.},

These correlations improve to R = 0.90 when the effect of disulfide bonds on the accessible area of the unfolded protein is included. A similar dependence on accessible surface area has been found previously for the heat capacity change (delta Cp), which is confirmed here for our set of proteins.

abstract = {Protein folding mechanisms are probed experimentally using single-point mutant perturbations. The relative effects on the folding (phi-values) and unfolding (1 - phi) rates are used to infer the detailed structure of the transition-state ensemble (TSE). Here we analyze kinetic data on > 800 mutations carried out for 24 proteins with simple kinetic behavior. We find two surprising results: (i) all mutant effects are described by the equation: DeltaDeltaG(double dagger)(unfold)=0.76DeltaDeltaG(eq) +/- 1.8kJ/mol. Therefore all data are consistent with a single phi-value (0.24) with accuracy comparable to experimental precision, suggesting that the structural information in conventional phi-values is low. (ii) phi-values change with stability, increasing in mean value and spread from native to unfolding conditions, and thus cannot be interpreted without proper normalization. We eliminate stability effects calculating the phi-values at the mutant denaturation midpoints; i.e., conditions of zero stability (phi(0)). We then show that the intrinsic variability is phi(0) = 0.36 +/- 0.11, being somewhat larger for beta-sheet-rich proteins than for alpha-helical proteins. Importantly, we discover that phi(0)-values are proportional to how many of the residues surrounding the mutated site are local in sequence. High phi(0)-values correspond to protein surface sites, which have few nonlocal neighbors, whereas core residues with many tertiary interactions produce the lowest phi(0)-values. These results suggest a general mechanism in which the TSE at zero stability is a broad conformational ensemble stabilized by local interactions and without specific tertiary interactions, reconciling phi-values with many other empirical observations.},

To test the method, we compare the thermodynamic barrier heights for 15 proteins obtained from available DSC data with the folding rates measured in kinetic experiments. The correlation between these two parameters is very good (r2 = 0.9) and has a slope consistent with the same energy scale.

abstract = {De novo designed peptides, capable of undergoing a thermally triggered ?-strand-swapped self-assembly event leading to hydrogel formation were prepared. Strand-swapping peptide 1 (SSP1) incorporates an exchangeable ?-strand domain composed of eight residues appended to a nonexchangeable ?-hairpin domain. CD shows that, at pH 9 and temperatures less than 35 °C, this peptide adopts a random coil conformation, rendering it soluble in aqueous solution. On heating to 37 °C or greater, SSP1 adopts a ?-hairpin that displays an exchangeable ?-strand region. The exchangeable strand domain participates in swapping with the exchangeable domain of another peptide, affording a strand-swapped dimer. These dimers further assemble into fibrils that define the hydrogel. A second peptide (SSP2) containing an exchangeable strand composed of only four residues was also studied. Microscopy and scattering data show that the length of the exchangeable domain directly influences the fibril nanostructure and can be used as a design element to construct either twisted (SSP1) or nontwisted (SSP2) fibril morphologies. CD, FTIR, and WAXS confirm that both peptides adopt ?-sheet secondary structure when assembled into fibrils. Fibril dimensions, as measured by TEM, AFM, and SANS indicate a fibril diameter of 6.4 nm, a height of 6.0 nm, and a pitch of 50.4 nm for the twisted SSP1 fibrils. The nontwisted SSP2 fibrils are 6.2 nm in diameter and 2.5 nm in height. Oscillatory rheology, used to measure bulk hydrogel rigidity, showed that the gel composed of the nontwisted fibrils is more mechanically rigid (517 Pa at 6 rad/s) than the gel composed of twisted fibrils (367 Pa at 6 rad/s). This work demonstrates that ?-strand-swapping can be used to fabricate biomaterials with tunable fibril nanostructure and bulk hydrogel rheological properties.},

abstract = {The understanding, and even the description of protein folding is impeded by the complexity of the process. Much of this complexity can be described and understood by taking a statistical approach to the energetics of protein conformation, that is, to the energy landscape. The statistical energy landscape approach explains when and why unique behaviors, such as specific folding pathways, occur in some proteins and more generally explains the distinction between folding processes common to all sequences and those peculiar to individual sequences. This approach also gives new, quantitative insights into the interpretation of experiments and simulations of protein folding thermodynamics and kinetics. Specifically, the picture provides simple explanations for folding as a two-state first-order phase transition, for the origin of metastable collapsed unfolded states and for the curved Arrhenius plots observed in both laboratory experiments and discrete lattice simulations. The relation of these quantitative ideas to folding pathways, to uniexponential vs. multiexponential behavior in protein folding experiments and to the effect of mutations on folding is also discussed. The success of energy landscape ideas in protein structure prediction is also described. The use of the energy landscape approach for analyzing data is illustrated with a quantitative analysis of some recent simulations, and a qualitative analysis of experiments on the folding of three proteins. The work unifies several previously proposed ideas concerning the mechanism protein folding and delimits the regions of validity of these ideas under different thermodynamic conditions.},

abstract = {Is the folding pathway conserved in homologous proteins? To address this question, we compared the folding pathways of goat alpha-lactalbumin and canine milk lysozyme using equilibrium and kinetic circular dichroism spectroscopy. Both Ca(2+)-binding proteins have 41\% sequence identity and essentially identical backbone structures. The Phi-value analysis, based on the effect of Ca(2+) on the folding kinetics, showed that the Ca(2+)-binding site was well organized in the transition state in alpha-lactalbumin, although it was not yet organized in lysozyme. Equilibrium unfolding and hydrogen-exchange 2D NMR analysis of the molten globule intermediate also showed that different regions were stabilized in the two proteins. In alpha-lactalbumin, the Ca(2+)-binding site and the C-helix were weakly organized, whereas the A- and B-helices, both distant from the Ca(2+)-binding site, were well organized in lysozyme. The results thus provide an example of highly homologous proteins taking different folding pathways. To understand the molecular origin of this difference, we investigated the native three-dimensional structures of the proteins in terms of non-local contact clusters, a parameter based on the residue-residue contact map and known to be well correlated with the folding rate of non-two-state proteins. There were remarkable differences between the proteins in the distribution of the non-local contact clusters, and these differences provided a reasonable explanation of the observed difference in the folding initiation sites. In conclusion, the protein folding pathway is determined not only by the backbone topology but also by the specific side-chain interactions of contacting residues.},

abstract = {The Hofmeister effect consists in changes of protein solubility triggered by neutral electrolyte cosolutes. Based on the assumption that salts cause stochastic fluctuations of the free energy barrier profiles, a kinetic theory of this phenomenon is proposed. An exponentially correlated noise, of amplitude proportional to the salt concentration, is added to each energy level, and the time-dependence of the mean protein concentration is calculated. It is found that the theory yields the well-known Setschenow equation if the noise correlation time is low in comparison to the aggregation time constant. Experimental data on salting-in agents are well fitted, whereas, in the case of salting-out cosolutes, two independent dichotomic fluctuations are needed to fit the data. This may result from the fact that, in both cases, the low-concentration regime is dominated by salting-in electrostatic contributions, whereas, at high salt concentrations, electron donor/acceptor interactions become important; these have opposite effects. The theory offers a novel way to metricate Hofmeister effects and also leads to thermodynamic quantities, which account for the influence of salts. The formalism may also be applied to describe kinetic phenomena in the presence of cosolutes.},

abstract = {We have prepared a family of peptide fragments of the 64 amino acid protein chymotrypsin inhibitor (CI2), corresponding to progressive elongation from the N terminus, in order to elucidate the basis of conformational preferences in single-domain proteins and to obtain insights into their conformational pathway. Structural analysis of the fragment comprising the first 50 residues, CI2(1-50), indicates that it is mainly disordered, with patches of hydrophobic residues exposed to the solvent. Structural characterisation of the fragment CI2(1-63) which lacks only the C-terminal glycine, Gly64, shows native-like structure in all regions of the fragment. The study provides insights into the contribution of specific residues to the stability and co-operativity of the intact protein. We define a phiNMR value, derived from chemical shift analysis, which describes the build-up of structure at the level of individual residues (protons). All the macroscopic probes used to study the growth of structure in CI2 on elongation of the chain (circular dichroism, fluorescence and gel filtration) are in agreement with the residue-by-residue description by NMR. It is seen that secondary and tertiary structure build up in parallel in the fragments and show similar structures to those developed in the transition state for folding of the intact protein.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single-module proteins, such as chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2), fold as a single cooperative unit. To solve its folding pathway, we must characterize, under conditions that favour folding, its denatured state, its transition state, and its final folded structure. To obtain a "denatured state' that can readily be thus characterized, we have used a trick of cleaving CI2 into two complementary fragments that associate and fold in a similar way to intact protein. RESULTS: Fragment CI2(1-40)-which contains the sequence of the single alpha-helix, spanning residues 12-24-and CI2(41-64), and mutants thereof, were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy, the transition state for association/folding was characterized by the protein engineering method, and the structure of the complex was solved by NMR and X-ray crystallography. Both isolated fragments are largely disordered. The transition state for association/folding is structured around a nucleus of a nearly fully formed alpha-helix, as is the transition state for the folding of intact CI2, from residues Ser12 to Leu21, Ala16, a residue from the helix whose sidechain is buried in the hydrophobic core, makes interactions with Leu49 and Ile57 in the other fragment. Ala16 makes its full interaction energy in the transition state for the association/folding reaction, just as found during the folding of the intact protein. CONCLUSIONS: The specific contacts in the transition state from a nucleus that extends from one fragment to the next, but the nucleus is only "flickeringly' present in the denatured state. This is direct evidence for the nucleation-condensation mechanism in which the nucleus is only weakly formed in the ground state and develops in the transition state. The low conformational preferences in the denatured state are not enough to induce significant local secondary structure, but are reinforced by tertiary interactions during the rapid condensation around the nucleus.},

Amyloid fibrils are associated with fatal diseases such as Alzheimer's, and amyloid-like fibrils can be formed in vitro. For the yeast protein Sup35, conversion to amyloid-like fibrils is associated with a transmissible infection akin to that caused by mammalian prions. A seven-residue peptide segment from Sup35 forms amyloid-like fibrils and closely related microcrystals, from which we have determined the atomic structure of the cross-beta spine. It is a double beta-sheet, with each sheet formed from parallel segments stacked in register. Side chains protruding from the two sheets form a dry, tightly self-complementing steric zipper, bonding the sheets. Within each sheet, every segment is bound to its two neighbouring segments through stacks of both backbone and side-chain hydrogen bonds. The structure illuminates the stability of amyloid fibrils, their self-seeding characteristic and their tendency to form polymorphic structures.},

abstract = {Protein-engineering methods (Phi-values) were used to investigate the folding transition state of a lysin motif (LysM) domain from Escherichia coli membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase D. This domain consists of just 48 structured residues in a symmetrical betaalphaalphabeta arrangement and is the smallest alphabeta protein yet investigated using these methods. An extensive mutational analysis revealed a highly robust folding pathway with no detectable transition state plasticity, indicating that LysM is an example of an ideal two-state folder. The pattern of Phi-values denotes a highly polarised transition state, with significant formation of the helices but no structure within the beta-sheet. Remarkably, this transition state remains polarised after circularisation of the domain, and exhibits an identical Phi-value pattern; however, the interactions within the transition state are uniformly weaker in the circular variant. This observation is supported by results from an Eyring analysis of the folding rates of the two proteins. We propose that the folding pathway of LysM is dominated by enthalpic rather than entropic considerations, and suggest that the lower entropy cost of formation of the circular transition state is balanced, to some extent, by the lower enthalpy of contacts within this structure.},

abstract = {An important question in protein folding is whether molten globule states formed under equilibrium conditions are good structural models for kinetic folding intermediates. The structures of the kinetic and equilibrium intermediates in the folding of the plant globin apoleghemoglobin have been compared at high resolution by quench-flow pH-pulse labeling and interrupted hydrogen/deuterium exchange analyzed in dimethyl sulfoxide. Unlike its well studied homolog apomyoglobin, where the equilibrium and kinetic intermediates are quite similar, there are striking structural differences between the intermediates formed by apoleghemoglobin. In the kinetic intermediate, formed during the burst phase of the quench-flow experiment, protected amides and helical structure are found mainly in the regions corresponding to the G and H helices of the folded protein, and in parts of the E helix and CE loop regions, whereas in the equilibrium intermediate, amide protection and helical structure are seen in parts of the A and B helix regions, as well as in the G and H regions, and the E helix remains largely unfolded. These results suggest that the structure of the molten globule intermediate of apoleghemoglobin is more plastic than that of apomyoglobin, so that it is readily transformed depending on the solution conditions, particularly pH. Thus, in the case of apoleghemoglobin at least, the equilibrium molten globule formed under destabilizing conditions at acid pH is not a good model for the compact intermediate formed during kinetic refolding experiments. Our high-precision kinetic analysis also reveals an additional slow phase during the folding of apoleghemoglobin, which is not observed for apomyoglobin. Hydrogen exchange pulse-labeling experiments show that the slow-folding phase is associated with residues in the CE loop, which probably forms non-native structure in the intermediate that must be resolved before folding can proceed to completion.},

abstract = {Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to probe the interactions that stabilize the equilibrium and burst phase kinetic intermediates formed by apomyoglobin. Nine bulky hydrophobic residues in the A, E, G and H helices were replaced by alanine, and the effects on protein stability and kinetic folding pathways were determined. Hydrogen exchange pulse-labeling experiments, with NMR detection, were performed for all mutants. All of the alanine substitutions resulted in changes in proton occupancy or an increased rate of hydrogen-deuterium exchange for amides in the immediate vicinity of the mutation. In addition, most mutations affected residues in distant parts of the amino acid sequence, providing insights into the topology of the burst phase intermediate and the interactions that stabilize its structure. Differences between the pH 4 equilibrium molten globule and the kinetic intermediate are evident: the E helix region plays no discernible role in the equilibrium intermediate, but contributes significantly to stabilization of the ensemble of compact intermediates formed during kinetic refolding. Mutations that interfere with docking of the E helix onto the preformed A/B/G/H helix core substantially decrease the folding rate, indicating that docking and folding of the E helix region occurs prior to formation of the apomyoglobin folding transition state. The results of the mutagenesis experiments are consistent with rapid formation of an ensemble of compact burst phase intermediates with an overall native-like topological arrangement of the A, B, E, G, and H helices. However, the experiments also point to disorder in docking of the E helix and to non-native contacts in the kinetic intermediate. In particular, there is evidence for translocation of the H helix by approximately one helical turn towards its N terminus to maximize hydrophobic interactions with helix G. Thus, the burst phase intermediate observed during kinetic refolding of apomyoglobin consists of an ensemble of compact, kinetically trapped states in which the helix docking appears to be topologically correct, but in which there are local non-native interactions that must be resolved before the protein can fold to the native structure.},

abstract = {The F helix region of sperm whale apomyoglobin is disordered, undergoing conformational fluctuations between a folded helical conformation and one or more locally unfolded states. To examine the effects of F helix stabilization on the folding pathway of apomyoglobin, we have introduced mutations to augment intrinsic helical structure in the F helix of the kinetic folding intermediate and to increase its propensity to fold early in the pathway, using predictions based on plots of the average area buried upon folding (AABUF) derived from the primary sequence. Two mutant proteins were prepared: a double mutant, P88K/S92K (F2), and a quadruple mutant, P88K/A90L/S92K/A94L (F4). Whereas the AABUF for F2 predicts that the F helix will not fold early in the pathway, the F helix in F4 shows a significantly increased AABUF and is therefore predicted to fold early. Protection of amide protons by formation of hydrogen-bonded helical structure during the early folding events has been analyzed by pH-pulse labeling. Consistent with the AABUF prediction, many of the F helix residues for F4 are significantly protected in the kinetic intermediate but are not protected in the F2 mutant. F4 folds via a kinetically trapped burst-phase intermediate that contains stabilized secondary structure in the A, B, F, G, and H helix regions. Rapid folding of the F helix stabilizes the central core of the misfolded intermediate and inhibits translocation of the H helix back to its native position, thereby decreasing the overall folding rate.},

abstract = {Apomyoglobin folds by a sequential mechanism in which the A, G, and H helix regions undergo rapid collapse to form a compact intermediate onto which the central portion of the B helix subsequently docks. To investigate the factors that frustrate folding, we have made mutations in the N-terminus of the B helix to stabilize helical structure (in the mutant G23A/G25A) and to promote native-like hydrophobic packing interactions with helix G (in the mutant H24L/H119F). The kinetic and equilibrium intermediates of G23A/G25A and H24L/H119F were studied by hydrogen exchange pulse labeling and interrupted hydrogen/deuterium exchange combined with NMR. For both mutants, stabilization of helical structure in the N-terminal region of the B helix is confirmed by increased exchange protection in the equilibrium molten globule states near pH 4. Increased protection is also observed in the GH turn region in the G23A/G25A mutant, suggesting that stabilization of the B helix facilitates native-like interactions with the C-terminal region of helix G. These interactions are further enhanced in H24L/H119F. The kinetic burst phase intermediates of both mutants show increased protection, relative to wild-type protein, of amides in the N-terminus of the B helix and in part of the E helix. Stabilization of the E helix in the intermediate is attributed to direct interactions between E helix residues and the newly stabilized N-terminus of helix B. Stabilization of native packing between the B and G helices in H24L/H119F also favors formation of native-like interactions in the GH turn and between the G and H helices in the ensemble of burst phase intermediates. We conclude that instability at the N-terminus of the B helix of apomyoglobin contributes to the energetic frustration of folding by preventing docking and stabilization of the E helix.},

abstract = {Local hydrophobic collapse of the polypeptide chain and transient long-range interactions in unfolded states of apomyoglobin appear to occur in regions of the amino acid sequence which, upon folding, bury an above-average area of hydrophobic surface. To explore the role of these interactions in protein folding, we prepared and characterized apomyoglobins with compensating point mutations designed to change the average buried surface area in local regions of the sequence, while conserving as much as possible the constitution of the hydrophobic core. The behavior of the mutants in quench-flow experiments to determine the folding pathway was exactly as predicted by the changes in the buried surface area parameter calculated from the amino acid sequence. In addition, spin label experiments with acid-unfolded mutant apomyoglobin showed that the transient long-range contacts that occur in the wild-type protein are abolished in the mutant, while new contacts are observed between areas that now have above-average buried surface area. We conclude that specific groupings of amino acid side-chains, which can be predicted from the sequence, are responsible for early hydrophobic interactions in the first phase of folding in apomyoglobin, and that these early interactions determine the subsequent course of the folding process.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to estimate transition rates between conformational substates of the simulated molecule. Such an estimation is associated with statistical uncertainty, which depends on the number of observed transitions. In turn, it induces uncertainties in any property computed from the simulation, such as free energy differences or the time scales involved in the system's kinetics. Assessing these uncertainties is essential for testing the reliability of a given observation and also to plan further simulations in such a way that the most serious uncertainties will be reduced with minimal effort. Here, a rigorous statistical method is proposed to approximate the complete statistical distribution of any observable of an MD simulation provided that one can identify conformational substates such that the transition process between them may be modeled with a memoryless jump process, i.e., Markov or Master equation dynamics. The method is based on sampling the statistical distribution of Markov transition matrices that is induced by the observed transition events. It allows physically meaningful constraints to be included, such as sampling only matrices that fulfill detailed balance, or matrices that produce a predefined equilibrium distribution of states. The method is illustrated on mus MD simulations of a hexapeptide for which the distributions and uncertainties of the free energy differences between conformations, the transition matrix elements, and the transition matrix eigenvalues are estimated. It is found that both constraints, detailed balance and predefined equilibrium distribution, can significantly reduce the uncertainty of some observables.},

abstract = {There is a gap between kinetic experiment and simulation in their views of the dynamics of complex biomolecular systems. Whereas experiments typically reveal only a few readily discernible exponential relaxations, simulations often indicate complex multistate behavior. Here, a theoretical framework is presented that reconciles these two approaches. The central concept is "dynamical fingerprints" which contain peaks at the time scales of the dynamical processes involved with amplitudes determined by the experimental observable. Fingerprints can be generated from both experimental and simulation data, and their comparison by matching peaks permits assignment of structural changes present in the simulation to experimentally observed relaxation processes. The approach is applied here to a test case interpreting single molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments on a set of fluorescent peptides with molecular dynamics simulations. The peptides exhibit complex kinetics shown to be consistent with the apparent simplicity of the experimental data. Moreover, the fingerprint approach can be used to design new experiments with site-specific labels that optimally probe specific dynamical processes in the molecule under investigation.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation generates large quantities of data that must be interpreted using physically meaningful analysis. A common approach is to describe the system dynamics in terms of transitions between coarse partitions of conformational space. In contrast to previous work that partitions the space according to geometric proximity, the authors examine here clustering based on kinetics, merging configurational microstates together so as to identify long-lived, i.e., dynamically metastable, states. As test systems microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of the polyalanines Ala(8) and Ala(12) are analyzed. Both systems clearly exhibit metastability, with some kinetically distinct metastable states being geometrically very similar. Using the backbone torsion rotamer pattern to define the microstates, a definition is obtained of metastable states whose lifetimes considerably exceed the memory associated with interstate dynamics, thus allowing the kinetics to be described by a Markov model. This model is shown to be valid by comparison of its predictions with the kinetics obtained directly from the molecular dynamics simulations. In contrast, clustering based on the hydrogen-bonding pattern fails to identify long-lived metastable states or a reliable Markov model. Finally, an approach is proposed to generate a hierarchical model of networks, each having a different number of metastable states. The model hierarchy yields a qualitative understanding of the multiple time and length scales in the dynamics of biomolecules.},

abstract = {Markov state models (MSMs) have been successful in computing metastable states, slow relaxation timescales and associated structural changes, and stationary or kinetic experimental observables of complex molecules from large amounts of molecular dynamics simulation data. However, MSMs approximate the true dynamics by assuming a Markov chain on a clusters discretization of the state space. This approximation is difficult to make for high-dimensional biomolecular systems, and the quality and reproducibility of MSMs has, therefore, been limited. Here, we discard the assumption that dynamics are Markovian on the discrete clusters. Instead, we only assume that the full phase-space molecular dynamics is Markovian, and a projection of this full dynamics is observed on the discrete states, leading to the concept of Projected Markov Models (PMMs). Robust estimation methods for PMMs are not yet available, but we derive a practically feasible approximation via Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). It is shown how various molecular observables of interest that are often computed from MSMs can be computed from HMMs/PMMs. The new framework is applicable to both, simulation and single-molecule experimental data. We demonstrate its versatility by applications to educative model systems, a 1 ms Anton MD simulation of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor protein, and an optical tweezer force probe trajectory of an RNA hairpin.},

In other words, what interactions govern the molecule's energy landscape? To accomplish this, it is necessary to determine which degrees of freedom can unambiguously identify each transition state. Here, we perform simulations of large-scale aminoacyl-transfer RNA (aa-tRNA) rearrangements during accommodation on the ribosome and project the dynamics along experimentally accessible atomic distances. From this analysis, we obtain evidence for which coordinates capture the correct number of barrier-crossing events and accurately indicate when the aa-tRNA is on a transition path. Although a commonly used coordinate in single-molecule experiments performs poorly, this study implicates alternative coordinates along which rearrangements are accurately described as diffusive movements across a one-dimensional free-energy profile. From this, we provide the theoretical foundation required for single-molecule techniques to uncover the energy landscape governing aa-tRNA selection by the ribosome.},

abstract = {Evolution has selected a protein's sequence to be consistent with the native state geometry, as this configuration must be both thermodynamically stable and kinetically accessible to prevent misfolding and loss of function. In simple protein geometries, such as coiled-coil helical bundles, symmetry produces a competing, globally different, near mirror image with identical secondary structure and similar native contact interactions. Experimental techniques such as circular dichroism, which rely on probing secondary structure content, cannot readily distinguish these folds. Here, we want to clarify whether the native fold and mirror image are energetically competitive by investigating the free energy landscape of three-helix bundles. To prevent a bias from a specific computational approach, the present study employs the structure prediction forcefield PFF01/02, explicit solvent replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) with the Amber94 forcefield, and structure-based simulations based on energy landscape theory. We observe that the native fold and its mirror image have a similar enthalpic stability and are thermodynamically competitive. There is evidence that the mirror fold has faster folding kinetics and could function as a kinetic trap. All together, our simulations suggest that mirror images might not just be a computational annoyance but are competing folds that might switch depending on environmental conditions or functional considerations.},

abstract = {Structure-based models (SBMs) are simplified models of the biomolecular dynamics that arise from funneled energy landscapes. We recently introduced an all-atom SBM that explicitly represents the atomic geometry of a biomolecule. While this initial study showed the robustness of the all-atom SBM Hamiltonian to changes in many of the energetic parameters, an important aspect, which has not been explored previously, is the definition of native interactions. In this study, we propose a general definition for generating atomically grained contact maps called "Shadow". The Shadow algorithm initially considers all atoms within a cutoff distance and then, controlled by a screening parameter, discards the occluded contacts. We show that this choice of contact map is not only well behaved for protein folding, since it produces consistently cooperative folding behavior in SBMs but also desirable for exploring the dynamics of macromolecular assemblies since, it distributes energy similarly between RNAs and proteins despite their disparate internal packing. All-atom structure-based models employing Shadow contact maps provide a general framework for exploring the geometrical features of biomolecules, especially the connections between folding and function.},

Consequently, despite dramatic advances in computational methodologies and resources, CG models enjoy surging popularity and are becoming increasingly equal partners to atomically detailed models. This perspective surveys the rapidly developing landscape of CG models for biomolecular systems. In particular, this review seeks to provide a balanced, coherent, and unified presentation of several distinct approaches for developing CG models, including top-down, network-based, native-centric, knowledge-based, and bottom-up modeling strategies. The review summarizes their basic philosophies, theoretical foundations, typical applications, and recent developments. Additionally, the review identifies fundamental inter-relationships among the diverse approaches and discusses outstanding challenges in the field. When carefully applied and assessed, current CG models provide highly efficient means for investigating the biological consequences of basic physicochemical principles. Moreover, rigorous bottom-up approaches hold great promise for further improving the accuracy and scope of CG models for biomolecular systems.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) models provide a computationally efficient method for rapidly investigating the long time- and length-scale processes that play a critical role in many important biological and soft matter processes. Recently, Izvekov and Voth introduced a new multiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) method [J. Phys. Chem. B 109, 2469 (2005); J. Chem. Phys. 123, 134105 (2005)] for determining the effective interactions between CG sites using information from simulations of atomically detailed models. The present work develops a formal statistical mechanical framework for the MS-CG method and demonstrates that the variational principle underlying the method may, in principle, be employed to determine the many-body potential of mean force (PMF) that governs the equilibrium distribution of positions of the CG sites for the MS-CG models. A CG model that employs such a PMF as a "potential energy function" will generate an equilibrium probability distribution of CG sites that is consistent with the atomically detailed model from which the PMF is derived. Consequently, the MS-CG method provides a formal multiscale bridge rigorously connecting the equilibrium ensembles generated with atomistic and CG models. The variational principle also suggests a class of practical algorithms for calculating approximations to this many-body PMF that are optimal. These algorithms use computer simulation data from the atomically detailed model. Finally, important generalizations of the MS-CG method are introduced for treating systems with rigid intramolecular constraints and for developing CG models whose equilibrium momentum distribution is consistent with that of an atomically detailed model.},

Phys. 123, 134105 (2005)] employs a variational principle to determine an interaction potential for a CG model from simulations of an atomically detailed model of the same system. The companion paper proved that, if no restrictions regarding the form of the CG interaction potential are introduced and if the equilibrium distribution of the atomistic model has been adequately sampled, then the MS-CG variational principle determines the exact many-body potential of mean force (PMF) governing the equilibrium distribution of CG sites generated by the atomistic model. In practice, though, CG force fields are not completely flexible, but only include particular types of interactions between CG sites, e.g., nonbonded forces between pairs of sites. If the CG force field depends linearly on the force field parameters, then the vector valued functions that relate the CG forces to these parameters determine a set of basis vectors that span a vector subspace of CG force fields. The companion paper introduced a distance metric for the vector space of CG force fields and proved that the MS-CG variational principle determines the CG force force field that is within that vector subspace and that is closest to the force field determined by the many-body PMF. The present paper applies the MS-CG variational principle for parametrizing molecular CG force fields and derives a linear least squares problem for the parameter set determining the optimal approximation to this many-body PMF. Linear systems of equations for these CG force field parameters are derived and analyzed in terms of equilibrium structural correlation functions. Numerical calculations for a one-site CG model of methanol and a molecular CG model of the EMIM(+)NO(3) (-) ionic liquid are provided to illustrate the method.},

abstract = {How tightly packed is the hydrophobic core of a folding transition state structure? We have addressed this question by characterizing the effects on folding kinetics of > 40 substitutions of both large and small amino acids in the hydrophobic core of the Fyn SH3 domain. Our results show that residues at three positions, which we designate as the 'core folding nucleus', are tightly packed in the transition state, and substitutions at these positions cause the largest changes in the folding rate. The other six positions examined appear to be loosely packed; thus, substitutions at these positions with larger hydrophobic residues generally accelerate folding, presumably by increasing the rate of nonspecific hydrophobic collapse. Surprisingly, the folding rate can be greatly accelerated by residues that also significantly destabilize the native state structure. Furthermore, mutants with identical thermodynamic stability can differ by up to 55-fold in their folding rates. These results highlight the importance of hydrophobic core composition, as opposed to only topology, in determining the folding rate of a protein. They also provide a new explanation for the 'abnormal' phi-values observed in many protein folding kinetics studies.},

abstract = {The SH3 domain folding transition state structure contains two well-ordered turn regions, known as the diverging turn and the distal loop. In the Src SH3 domain transition state, these regions are stabilized by a hydrogen bond between Glu30 in the diverging turn and Ser47 in the distal loop. We have examined the effects on folding kinetics of amino acid substitutions at the homologous positions (Glu24 and Ser41) in the Fyn SH3 domain. In contrast to most other folding kinetics studies which have focused primarily on non-disruptive substitutions with Ala or Gly, here we have examined the effects of substitutions with diverse amino acid residues. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the transition state structure is generally tolerant to amino acid substitutions. We also uncover a unique role for Ser at position 41 in facilitating folding of the distal loop, which can only be replicated by Asp at the same position. Both these residues appear to accelerate folding through the formation of short-range side-chain to backbone hydrogen bonds. The folding of the diverging turn region is shown to be driven primarily by local interactions. The diverging turn and distal loop regions are found to interact in the transition state structure, but only in the context of particular mutant backgrounds. This work demonstrates that studying the effects of a variety of amino acid substitutions on protein folding kinetics can provide unique insights into folding mechanisms which cannot be obtained by standard Phi value analysis.},

abstract = {General anaesthetics have enjoyed long and widespread use but their molecular mechanism of action remains poorly understood. There is good evidence that their principal targets are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) such as inhibitory GABA(A) ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid) receptors and excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are respectively potentiated and inhibited by general anaesthetics. The bacterial homologue from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC), whose X-ray structure was recently solved, is also sensitive to clinical concentrations of general anaesthetics. Here we describe the crystal structures of the complexes propofol/GLIC and desflurane/GLIC. These reveal a common general-anaesthetic binding site, which pre-exists in the apo-structure in the upper part of the transmembrane domain of each protomer. Both molecules establish van der Waals interactions with the protein; propofol binds at the entrance of the cavity whereas the smaller, more flexible, desflurane binds deeper inside. Mutations of some amino acids lining the binding site profoundly alter the ionic response of GLIC to protons, and affect its general-anaesthetic pharmacology. Molecular dynamics simulations, performed on the wild type (WT) and two GLIC mutants, highlight differences in mobility of propofol in its binding site and help to explain these effects. These data provide a novel structural framework for the design of general anaesthetics and of allosteric modulators of brain pLGICs.},

abstract = {We present a method for determining structural properties of the ensemble of folding transition states from protein simulations. This method relies on thermodynamic quantities (free energies as a function of global reaction coordinates, such as the percentage of native contacts) and not on "kinetic" measurements (rates, transmission coefficients, complete trajectories); consequently, it requires fewer computational resources compared with other approaches, making it more suited to large and complex models. We explain the theoretical framework that underlies this method and use it to clarify the connection between the experimentally determined Phi value, a quantity determined by the ratio of rate and stability changes due to point mutations, and the average structure of the transition state ensemble. To determine the accuracy of this thermodynamic approach, we apply it to minimalist protein models and compare these results with the ones obtained by using the standard experimental procedure for determining Phi values. We show that the accuracy of both methods depends sensitively on the amount of frustration. In particular, the results are similar when applied to models with minimal amounts of frustration, characteristic of rapid-folding, single-domain globular proteins.},

abstract = {In order to clarify the mechanism of denaturant-induced unfolding of proteins we have calculated the interactions between hydrophobic and ionic species in aqueous guanidinium chloride and urea solutions using molecular dynamics simulations. Hydrophobic association is not significantly changed in urea or guanidinium chloride solutions. The strength of interaction between ion pairs is greatly diminished by the guanidinium ion. Although the changes in electrostatic interactions in urea are small, examination of structures, using appropriate pair functions, of urea and water around the solutes show strong hydrogen bonding between urea's carbonyl oxygen and the positively charged solute. Our results strongly suggest protein denaturation occurs by the direct interaction model according to which the most commonly used denaturants unfold proteins by altering electrostatic interactions either by solvating the charged residues or by engaging in hydrogen bonds with the protein backbone. To further validate the direct interaction model we show that, in urea and guanidinium chloride solutions, unfolding of an unusually stable helix (H1) from mouse PrPC (residues 144-153) occurs by hydrogen bonding of denaturants to charged side chains and backbone carbonyl groups.},

A recent estimate suggests that 70\%-80\% of soluble protein domains identified in the first 1000 genome sequences should be covered by about 25,000 structures-a reasonably achievable goal. As no current estimates exist for the number of membrane protein families, however, it is not possible to know whether family coverage is a realistic goal for membrane proteins. Here we find that virtually all polytopic helical membrane protein families are present in the already known sequences so we can make an estimate of the total number of families. We find that only approximately 700 polytopic membrane protein families account for 80\% of structured residues and approximately 1700 cover 90\% of structured residues. While apparently a finite and reachable goal, we estimate that it will likely take more than three decades to obtain the structures needed for 90\% residue coverage, if current trends continue.},

abstract = {The ribosomal protein S6 from Thermus thermophilus has served as a model system for the study of protein folding, especially for understanding the effects of circular permutations of secondary structure elements. This study presents the structure of a permutant protein, the 96-residue P(54-55), and the structure of its 101-residue parent protein S6(wt) in solution. The data also characterizes the effects of circular permutation on the backbone dynamics of S6. Consistent with crystallographic data on S6(wt), the overall solution structures of both P(54-55) and S6(wt) show a beta-sheet of four antiparallel beta-strands with two alpha-helices packed on one side of the sheet. In clear contrast to the crystal data, however, the solution structure of S6(wt) reveals a disordered loop in the region between beta-strands 2 and 3 (Leu43-Phe60) instead of a well-ordered stretch and associated hydrophobic mini-core observed in the crystal structure. Moreover, the data for P(54-55) show that the joined wild-type N- and C-terminals form a dynamically robust stretch with a hairpin structure that complies with the in silico design. Taken together, the results explain why the loop region of the S6(wt) structure is relatively insensitive to mutational perturbations, and why P(54-55) is more stable than S6(wt): the permutant incision at Lys54-Asp55 is energetically neutral by being located in an already disordered loop whereas the new hairpin between the wild-type N- and C-termini is stabilizing.},

abstract = {Activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is triggered and regulated by structural rearrangement of the transmembrane heptahelical bundle containing a number of highly conserved residues. In rhodopsin, a prototypical GPCR, the helical bundle accommodates an intrinsic inverse-agonist 11-cis-retinal, which undergoes photo-isomerization to the all-trans form upon light absorption. Such a trigger by the chromophore corresponds to binding of a diffusible ligand to other GPCRs. Here we have explored the functional role of water molecules in the transmembrane region of bovine rhodopsin by using x-ray diffraction to 2.6 A. The structural model suggests that water molecules, which were observed in the vicinity of highly conserved residues and in the retinal pocket, regulate the activity of rhodopsin-like GPCRs and spectral tuning in visual pigments, respectively. To confirm the physiological relevance of the structural findings, we conducted single-crystal microspectrophotometry on rhodopsin packed in our three-dimensional crystals and show that its spectroscopic properties are similar to those previously found by using bovine rhodopsin in suspension or membrane environment.},

From only one simulation run, one can obtain canonical ensemble averages of physical quantities as functions of temperature by the single-histogram and/or multiple-histogram reweighting techniques. In this article we review the generalized ensemble algorithms. Three well-known methods, namely, multicanonical algorithm (MUCA), simulated tempering (ST), and replica-exchange method (REM), are described first.

abstract = {F1-ATPase, the catalytic domain of ATP synthase, synthesizes most of the ATP in living organisms. Running in reverse powered by ATP hydrolysis, this hexameric ring-shaped molecular motor formed by three $\alpha$$\beta$-dimers creates torque on its central $\gamma$-subunit. This reverse operation enables detailed explorations of the mechanochemical coupling mechanisms in experiment and simulation. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to construct a first atomistic conformation of the intermediate state following the 40° substep of rotary motion, and to study the timing and molecular mechanism of inorganic phosphate (Pi) release coupled to the rotation. In response to torque-driven rotation of the $\gamma$-subunit in the hydrolysis direction, the nucleotide-free $\alpha$$\beta$E interface forming the "empty" E site loosens and singly charged Pi readily escapes to the P loop. By contrast, the interface stays closed with doubly charged Pi. The $\gamma$-rotation tightens the ATP-bound $\alpha$$\beta$TP interface, as required for hydrolysis. The calculated rate for the outward release of doubly charged Pi from the $\alpha$$\beta$E interface 120° after ATP hydrolysis closely matches the \~{}1-ms functional timescale. Conversely, Pi release from the ADP-bound $\alpha$$\beta$DP interface postulated in earlier models would occur through a kinetically infeasible inward-directed pathway. Our simulations help reconcile conflicting interpretations of single-molecule experiments and crystallographic studies by clarifying the timing of Pi exit, its pathway and kinetics, associated changes in Pi protonation, and changes of the F1-ATPase structure in the 40° substep. Important elements of the molecular mechanism of Pi release emerging from our simulations appear to be conserved in myosin despite the different functional motions.},

abstract = {Biomolecules often undergo large-amplitude motions when they bind or release other molecules. Unlike macroscopic machines, these biomolecular machines can partially disassemble (unfold) and then reassemble (fold) during such transitions. Here we put forward a minimal structure-based model, the "multiple-basin model," that can directly be used for molecular dynamics simulation of even very large biomolecular systems so long as the endpoints of the conformational change are known. We investigate the model by simulating large-scale motions of four proteins: glutamine-binding protein, S100A6, dihydrofolate reductase, and HIV-1 protease. The mechanisms of conformational transition depend on the protein basin topologies and change with temperature near the folding transition. The conformational transition rate varies linearly with driving force over a fairly large range. This linearity appears to be a consequence of partial unfolding during the conformational transition.},

abstract = {The many-body physics of hydrogen bond formation in alpha-helices of globular proteins was investigated using a simple physics-based model. Specifically, a context-sensitive hydrogen bond potential, which depends on residue identity and degree of solvent exposure, was used in the framework of the Associated Memory Hamiltonian codes developed previously but without using local-sequence structure matches ("memories"). Molecular dynamics simulations employing the energy function using the context-sensitive hydrogen bond potential alone (the "amnesiac" model) were used to generate low energy structures for three alpha-helical test proteins. The resulting structures were compared to both the X-ray crystal structures of the test proteins and the results obtained using the full Associated Memory Hamiltonian previously used. Results show that the amnesiac Hamiltonian was able to generate structures with reasonably high structural similarity (Q approximately 0.4) to that of the native protein but only with the use of predicted secondary structure information encoding local steric signals. Low energy structures obtained using the amnesiac Hamiltonian without any a priori secondary structure information had considerably less similarity to the native protein structures (Q approximately 0.3). Both sets of results utilizing the amnesiac Hamiltonian are poorer than when local-sequence structure matches are used.},

Overall, IDP-associated biological activities complement those of structured proteins. Recently, there has been an explosion of studies on IDP regions and their functions, yet the discovery and investigation of these proteins have a long, mostly ignored history. Along with recent discoveries, we present several early examples and the mechanisms by which IDPs contribute to function, which we hope will encourage comprehensive discussion of IDPs and IDP regions in biochemistry textbooks.

@article{Oliveberg1995,
abstract = {Although the rates of chemical reactions become faster with increasing temperature, the converse may be observed with protein-folding reactions. The rate constant for folding initially increases with temperature, goes through a maximum, and then decreases. The activation enthalpy is thus highly temperature dependent because of a large change in specific heat (delta Cp). Such a delta Cp term is usually presumed to be a consequence of a large decrease in exposure of hydrophobic surfaces to water as the reaction proceeds from the denatured state to the transition state for folding: the hydrophobic side chains are surrounded by "icebergs" of water that melt with increasing temperature, thus making a large contribution to the Cp of the denatured state and a smaller one to the more compact transition state. The rate could also be affected by temperature-induced changes in the conformational population of the ground state: the heat required for the progressive melting of residual structure in the denatured state will contribute to delta Cp. By examining two proteins with different refolding mechanisms, we are able to find both of these two processes; barley chymotrypsin inhibitor 2, which refolds from a highly unfolded state, fits well to a hydrophobic interaction model with a constant delta Cp of activation, whereas barnase, which refolds from a more structured denatured state, deviates from this ideal behavior.},

abstract = {According to landscape theory proteins do not fold by localised pathways, but find their native conformation by a progressive organisation of an ensemble of partly folded structures down a folding funnel. Here, we use kinetics and protein engineering to investigate the shape of the free-energy profile for two-state folding, which is the macroscopic view of the funnel process for small and rapidly folding proteins. Our experiments are based mainly on structural changes of the transition state of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) upon destabilisation with temperature and GdnHCl. The transition state ensemble of CI2 is a localised feature in the free-energy profile that is sharply higher than the other parts of the activation barrier. The relatively fixed position of the CI2 transition state on the reaction coordinate makes it easy to characterise but contributes also to overshadow the rest of the free-energy profile, the shape of which is inaccessible for analysis. Results from mutants of CI2 and comparison with other two-state proteins, however, point at the possibility that the barrier for folding is generally broad and that localised transition states result from minor ripples in the free-energy profile. Accordingly, variabilities in the folding kinetics may not indicate different folding mechanisms, but could be accounted for by various degrees of ruggedness on top of very broad activation barriers for folding. The concept is attractive since it summarises a wide range of folding data which have previously seemed unrelated. It is also supported by theory. Consistent with experiment, broad barriers predict that new transition state ensembles are exposed upon extreme destabilisation or radical mutations.},

abstract = {The concept of a funneled energy landscape and the principle of minimal frustration are the theoretical foundation justifying the applicability of structure-based models. In simulations, a protein is commonly reduced to a C(alpha)-bead representation. These simulations are sufficient to predict the geometrical features of the folding mechanism observed experimentally utilizing a concise formulation of the Hamiltonian with low computational costs. Toward a better understanding of the interplay between energetic and geometrical features in folding, the side chain is now explicitly included in the simulations. The simplest choice is the addition of C(beta)-beads at the center-of-mass position of the side chains. While one varies the energetic parameters of the model, the geometric aspects of the folding mechanism remain robust for a broad range of parameters. Energetic properties like folding barriers and protein stability are sensitive to the details of simulations. This robustness to geometry and sensitivity to energetic properties provide flexibility in choosing different parameters to represent changes in sequences, environments, stability or folding rate effects. Therefore, minimal frustration and the funnel concept guarantee that the geometrical features are robust properties of the folding landscape, while mutations and/or changes in the environment easily influence energy-dependent properties like folding rates or stability.},

abstract = {Studies of circular permutants have demonstrated that the folding reaction of S6 from Thermus thermophilus (S6(T)) is malleable and responds in an ordered manner to changes of the sequence separation between interacting residues: the S6(T) permutants retain a common nucleation pattern in the form of a two-strand-helix motif that can be recruited from different parts of the structure. To further test the robustness of the two-strand-helix nucleus we have here determined the crystal structure and folding reaction of an evolutionary divergent S6 protein from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus (S6(A)). Although the overall topology of S6(A) is very similar to that of S6(T) the architecture of the hydrophobic core is radically different by containing a large proportion of stacked Phe side-chains. Despite this disparate core composition, the folding rate constant and the kinetic m values of S6(A) are identical to those of S6(T). The folding nucleus of S6(A) is also found to retain the characteristic two-strand-helix motif of the S6(T) permutants, but with a new structural emphasis. The results suggest that the protein folding reaction is linked to topology only in the sense that the native-state topology determines the repertoire of accessible nucleation motifs. If the native structure allows several equivalent ways of recruiting a productive nucleus the folding reaction is free to redistribute within these topological constraints.},

It assumes that folding occurs through organizing an ensemble of structures rather than through only a few uniquely defined structural intermediates. It suggests that the most realistic model of a protein is a minimally frustrated heteropolymer with a rugged funnel-like landscape biased toward the native structure. This statistical description has been developed using tools from the statistical mechanics of disordered systems, polymers, and phase transitions of finite systems. We review here its analytical background and contrast the phenomena in homopolymers, random heteropolymers, and protein-like heteropolymers that are kinetically and thermodynamically capable of folding. The connection between these statistical concepts and the results of minimalist models used in computer simulations is discussed. The review concludes with a brief discussion of how the theory helps in the interpretation of results from fast folding experiments and in the practical task of protein structure prediction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Energy landscape theory predicts that the folding funnel for a small fast-folding alpha-helical protein will have a transition state half-way to the native state. Estimates of the position of the transition state along an appropriate reaction coordinate can be obtained from linear free energy relationships observed for folding and unfolding rate constants as a function of denaturant concentration. The experimental results of Huang and Oas for lambda repressor, Fersht and collaborators for C12, and Gray and collaborators for cytochrome c indicate a free energy barrier midway between the folded and unfolded regions. This barrier arises from an entropic bottleneck for the folding process.

RESULTS: In keeping with the experimental results, lattice simulations based on the folding funnel description show that the transition state is not just a single conformation, but rather an ensemble of a relatively large number of configurations that can be described by specific values of one or a few order parameters (e.g. the fraction of native contacts). Analysis of this transition state or bottleneck region from our lattice simulations and from atomistic models for small alpha-helical proteins by Boczko and Brooks indicates a broad distribution for native contact participation in the transition state ensemble centered around 50\%. Importantly, however, the lattice-simulated transition state ensemble does include some particularly hot contacts, as seen in the experiments, which have been termed by others a folding nucleus.

CONCLUSIONS: Linear free energy relations provide a crude spectroscopy of the transition state, allowing us to infer the values of a reaction coordinate based on the fraction of native contacts. This bottleneck may be thought of as a collection of delocalized nuclei where different native contacts will have different degrees of participation. The agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions provides strong support for the landscape analysis.},

abstract = {Generalized Born (GB) models provide, for many applications, an accurate and computationally facile estimate of the electrostatic contribution to aqueous solvation. The GB models involve two main types of approximations relative to the Poisson equation (PE) theory on which they are based. First, the self-energy contributions of individual atoms are estimated and expressed as "effective Born radii." Next, the atom-pair contributions are estimated by an analytical function f(GB) that depends upon the effective Born radii and interatomic distance of the atom pairs. Here, the relative impacts of these approximations are investigated by calculating "perfect" effective Born radii from PE theory, and enquiring as to how well the atom-pairwise energy terms from a GB model using these perfect radii in the standard f(GB) function duplicate the equivalent terms from PE theory. In tests on several biological macromolecules, the use of these perfect radii greatly increases the accuracy of the atom-pair terms; that is, the standard form of f(GB) performs quite well. The remaining small error has a systematic and a random component. The latter cannot be removed without significantly increasing the complexity of the GB model, but an alternative choice of f(GB) can reduce the systematic part. A molecular dynamics simulation using a perfect-radii GB model compares favorably with simulations using conventional GB, even though the radii remain fixed in the former. These results quantify, for the GB field, the importance of getting the effective Born radii right; indeed, with perfect radii, the GB model gives a very good approximation to the underlying PE theory for a variety of biomacromolecular types and conformations.},

abstract = {The feasibility of predicting the global fold of small proteins by incorporating predicted secondary and tertiary restraints into ab initio folding simulations has been demonstrated on a test set comprised of 20 non-homologous proteins, of which one was a blind prediction of target 42 in the recent CASP2 contest. These proteins contain from 37 to 100 residues and represent all secondary structural classes and a representative variety of global topologies. Secondary structure restraints are provided by the PHD secondary structure prediction algorithm that incorporates multiple sequence information. Predicted tertiary restraints are derived from multiple sequence alignments via a two-step process. First, seed side-chain contacts are identified from correlated mutation analysis, and then a threading-based algorithm is used to expand the number of these seed contacts. A lattice-based reduced protein model and a folding algorithm designed to incorporate these predicted restraints is described. Depending upon fold complexity, it is possible to assemble native-like topologies whose coordinate root-mean-square deviation from native is between 3.0 A and 6.5 A. The requisite level of accuracy in side-chain contact map prediction can be roughly 25\% on average, provided that about 60\% of the contact predictions are correct within +/-1 residue and 95\% of the predictions are correct within +/-4 residues. Precision in tertiary contact prediction is more critical than absolute accuracy. Furthermore, only a subset of the tertiary contacts, on the order of 25\% of the total, is sufficient for successful topology assembly. Overall, this study suggests that the use of restraints derived from multiple sequence alignments combined with a fold assembly algorithm holds considerable promise for the prediction of the global topology of small proteins.},

abstract = {In many multi-repeat proteins, linkers between repeats have little secondary structure and place few constraints on folding or unfolding. However, the large family of spectrin-like proteins, including alpha-actinin, spectrin, and dystrophin, share three-helix bundle, spectrin repeats that appear in crystal structures to be linked by long helices. All of these proteins are regularly subjected to mechanical stress. Recent single molecule atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments demonstrate not only forced unfolding but also simultaneous unfolding of tandem repeats at finite frequency, which suggests that the contiguous helix between spectrin repeats can propagate a cooperative helix-to-coil transition. Here, we address what happens atomistically to the linker under stress by steered molecular dynamics simulations of tandem spectrin repeats in explicit water. The results for alpha-actinin repeats reveal rate-dependent pathways, with one pathway showing that the linker between repeats unfolds, which may explain the single-repeat unfolding pathway observed in AFM experiments. A second pathway preserves the structural integrity of the linker, which explains the tandem-repeat unfolding event. Unfolding of the linker begins with a splay distortion of proximal loops away from hydrophobic contacts with the linker. This is followed by linker destabilization and unwinding with increased hydration of the backbone. The end result is an unfolded helix that mechanically decouples tandem repeats. Molecularly detailed insights obtained here aid in understanding the mechanical coupling of domain stability in spectrin family proteins.},

abstract = {A methodology for flexible fitting of all-atom high-resolution structures into low-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps is presented. Flexibility of the modeled structure is simulated by classical molecular dynamics and an additional effective potential is introduced to enhance the fitting process. The additional potential is proportional to the correlation coefficient between the experimental cryo-EM map and a synthetic map generated for an all-atom structure being fitted to the map. The additional forces are calculated as a gradient of the correlation coefficient. During the molecular dynamics simulations under the additional forces, the molecule undergoes a conformational transition that maximizes the correlation coefficient, which results in a high-accuracy fit of all-atom structure into a cryo-EM map. Using five test proteins that exhibit structural rearrangement during their biological activity, we demonstrate performance of our method. We also test our method on the experimental cryo-EM of elongation factor G and show that the model obtained is comparable to previous studies. In addition, we show that overfitting can be avoided by assessing the quality of the fitted model in terms of correlation coefficient and secondary structure preservation.},

abstract = {Thirty years ago, Jaynes suggested a general theoretical approach to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, called maximum caliber (MaxCal) [Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 31, 579 (1980)]. MaxCal is a variational principle for dynamics in the same spirit that maximum entropy is a variational principle for equilibrium statistical mechanics. Motivated by the success of maximum entropy inference methods for equilibrium problems, in this work the MaxCal formulation is applied to the inference of nonequilibrium processes. That is, given some time-dependent observables of a dynamical process, one constructs a model that reproduces these input data and moreover, predicts the underlying dynamics of the system. For example, the observables could be some time-resolved measurements of the folding of a protein, which are described by a few-state model of the free energy landscape of the system. MaxCal then calculates the probabilities of an ensemble of trajectories such that on average the data are reproduced. From this probability distribution, any dynamical quantity of the system can be calculated, including population probabilities, fluxes, or waiting time distributions. After briefly reviewing the formalism, the practical numerical implementation of MaxCal in the case of an inference problem is discussed. Adopting various few-state models of increasing complexity, it is demonstrated that the MaxCal principle indeed works as a practical method of inference: The scheme is fairly robust and yields correct results as long as the input data are sufficient. As the method is unbiased and general, it can deal with any kind of time dependency such as oscillatory transients and multitime decays.},

abstract = {The 64-residue chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) folds by a two-state nucleation-condensation mechanism, whereby secondary and tertiary structure coalesce concomitantly in the transition state around Ala 16 in the helical N-cap. Permutation of the SH3-domain of alpha-spectrin apparently shifts its folding nucleus to another region of the protein, suggesting that a protein's transition state may be altered by altering the protein's connectivity. We have characterized the structure of the transition state of a circular and a permuted version of CI2 by a protein engineering study encompassing 11 mutations. Circular CI2 was obtained by the introduction of cysteines at residues 3 and 63 and linking them by disulfide bond formation. Subsequent cyanogen-bromide cleavage of the scissile bond, Met 40-Glu 41, yielded permuted CI2. Circular and permuted CI2 also fold according to a two-state mechanism. Permutation does not affect the folding rate constant, but circularization increases it 7-fold. The transition states of circular and permuted CI2 are essentially unchanged from that of wild-type CI2. Importantly, the folding nucleus around Ala16 is retained. These results complement a previous observation that the transition state for association of two CI2 fragments (residues 1-40 and 41-64, generated by CNBr cleavage) is very similar to the folding transition state of intact CI2. The similarity of rate constants for folding of wild-type and permuted CI2, and their value relative to that for the association of fragments, allows us to estimate the gain in entropy of activation on having the separate fragments linked: 18.3 cal M-1 K-1; i.e. an effective molarity of 10(4) M. The contrast between the retention of the folding nucleus on permutation of CI2 and its change for the SH3-domain of alpha-spectrin probably arises because the latter was cleaved in its folding nucleus whereas cleavage at sites other than 40-41 in CI2 is very destabilizing. Whether or not a folding nucleus can be changed probably depends on the specific protein and its permissivity to permutation.},

abstract = {The equilibrium and kinetics of folding of the single-domain protein chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 conform to the simple two-state model. The structure of the rate-determining transition state has been mapped out at the resolution of individual side chains by using the protein engineering method on 74 mutants that have been constructed at 37 of the 64 residues. The structure contains no elements of secondary structure that are fully formed. The majority of interactions are weakened by > 50\% in the transition state, although most regions do have some very weak structure. The structure of the transition state appears to be an expanded form of the native state in which secondary and tertiary elements have been partly formed concurrently. This is consistent with a "global collapse" model of folding rather than a framework model in which folding is initiated from fully preformed local secondary structural elements. This may be a general feature for the folding of proteins lacking a folding intermediate and is perhaps representative of the early stages of folding for multidomain or multimodule proteins. The major transition state for the folding of barnase, for example, has some fully formed secondary and tertiary structural elements in the major transition state, and barnase appears to form by a framework process. However, the fully formed framework may be preceded by a global collapse, and a unified folding scheme is presented.},

This construct also shows increased coil aggregation during refolding, and a 14-mer peptide encompassing the engineered sequence forms fibrils. Mutational analysis shows that intermolecular association is linked to the overall hydrophobicity of the sticky sequence and implies the existence of "structural gatekeepers" in the wild-type protein, that is, charged side chains that prevent aggregation by interrupting contiguous stretches of hydrophobic residues in the primary sequence.},

abstract = {The interpretation of folding rates is often rationalized within the context of transition state theory. This means that the reaction rate is linked to an activation barrier, the height of which is determined by the free energy difference between a ground state (the starting point) and an apparent transition state. Changes in the folding kinetics are thus caused by effects on either the ground state, the transition state, or both. However, structural changes of the transition state are rarely discussed in connection with experimental data, and kinetic anomalies are commonly ascribed to ground state effects alone, e.g., depletion or accumulation of structural intermediates upon addition of denaturant. In this study, we present kinetic data which are best described by transition state changes. We also show that ground state effects and transition state effects are in general difficult to distinguish kinetically. The analysis is based on the structurally homologous proteins U1A and S6. Both proteins display two-state behavior, but there is a marked difference in their kinetics. S6 exhibits a classical V-shaped chevron plot (log observed rate constant vs denaturant concentration), whereas U1A's chevron plot is symmetrically curved, like an inverted bell curve. However, S6 is readily mutated to display U1A-like kinetics. The seemingly drastic effects of these mutations are readily ascribed to transition state movements where large kinetic differences result from relatively small alterations of a common free energy profile and broad activation barriers.},

abstract = {When folding to the native state N in the presence of salt, the apparent two-state folder S6 transiently forms a transient off-pathway state C with substantial secondary and tertiary structure. Fifteen double mutant cycles were analysed to compare side-chain interaction energies DeltaDeltaG(int) in C, N and TS (the transition state between N and the denatured state). The kinetic signatures of these destabilizing mutants suggest folding scenarios involving unfolding intermediates and even alternative unfolding pathways. However, restricting the kinetic data to linear parts of the chevron plot allows reliable extrapolation to zero molar denaturant of rate constants of folding, unfolding and misfolding. Side-chain interactions appear to contribute to the stability of C, but in a substantially non-native environment, as shown by changes in the sign of DeltaDeltaG(int) between C and N. Remarkably, there appear to be significant (0.7-2 kcal/mol) antagonistic interactions between the two residues Leu30 and Leu75 in N and TS, which may be linked to subtle structural changes seen in the crystal structures of the mutants. A small number of overlapping residues are involved in these kinds of antagonistic interactions in N, TS and C, suggesting that repulsive interactions are coded into the protein topology whether the protein folds or misfolds. Destabilizing double mutants indicate that apparent two-state folders can be induced to behave in more complex ways provided that the native state is suitably destabilized.},

abstract = {Several studies have found millisecond protein folding reactions to be controlled by the viscosity of the solvent: Reducing the viscosity allows folding to accelerate. In the limit of very low solvent viscosity, however, one expects a different behavior. Internal interactions, occurring within the solvent-excluded interior of a compact molecule, should impose a solvent-independent upper limit to folding speed once the bulk diffusional motions become sufficiently rapid. Why has this not been observed? We have studied the effect of solvent viscosity on the folding of cytochrome c from a highly compact, late-stage intermediate configuration. Although the folding rate accelerates as the viscosity declines, it tends toward a finite limiting value approximately 10(5) s(-1) as the viscosity tends toward zero. This limiting rate is independent of the cosolutes used to adjust solvent friction. Therefore, interactions within the interior of a compact denatured polypeptide can limit the folding rate, but the limiting time scale is very fast. It is only observable when the solvent-controlled stages of folding are exceedingly rapid or else absent. Interestingly, we find a very strong temperature dependence in these "internal friction"-controlled dynamics, indicating a large energy scale for the interactions that govern reconfiguration within compact, near-native states of a protein.},

abstract = {We present a general approach in which theory and experiments are combined in an iterative manner to provide a detailed description of the transition state ensemble (TSE) for folding. The method is illustrated by applying it to TNfn3, a fibronectin type III domain protein. In the first iteration, a coarse-grained determination of the TSE is carried out by using a limited set of experimental phi values as constraints in a molecular dynamics sampling simulation. The resulting model of the TSE is used to determine the additional residues whose phi value measurement would provide the most information for refining the TSE. Successive iterations with an increasing number of phi value measurements are carried out until no further changes in the properties of the TSE are detected or there are no additional residues whose phi values can be measured. In the study of TNfn3 three iterations were necessary to achieve self-consistency. A retrospective application of the method can be used to determine the accuracy of the TSE results and to find "key residues" for folding, i.e., those that are most important for the formation of the TSE. The approach reported here is an efficient method for finding the structures that make up the TSEs for protein folding. Its use will improve future efforts for their experimental determination and refinement.},

abstract = {Delineation of the structural properties of transition states is key to deriving models for protein folding. Here we describe the structures of the transition states of the bacterial immunity proteins Im7 and Im9 obtained by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with phi value restraints derived from protein engineering experiments. This pair of proteins is of special interest because, at pH 7 and 10 degrees C, Im7 folds via an intermediate while Im9 folds with a two-state transition. The structures of the transition states for Im7 and Im9, together with their radii of gyration and distances from the native state, are similar. The typical distance between any two members of the transition state ensemble of both proteins is large, with that of Im9 nearly twice that of Im7. Thus, a broad range of structures make up the transition state ensembles of these proteins. The ensembles satisfy the set of rather low phi values and yet are consistent with high beta(T) values (> 0.85 for both proteins). For both Im7 and Im9 the inter-helical angles are highly variable in the transition state ensembles, although the native contacts between helices I and IV are well conserved. By measuring the distribution of the accessible surface area for each residue we show that the hydrophobic residues that are buried in the native state remain buried in the transition state, corresponding to a hydrophobic collapse to a relatively ordered globule. The data provide new insights into the structural properties of the transition states of these proteins at an atomic level of detail and show that molecular dynamics simulations with phi value restraints can significantly enhance the knowledge of the transition state ensembles (TSE) provided by the experimental phi values alone.},

abstract = {We have surveyed proteins with known atomic structure whose function involves electron transfer; in these, electrons can travel up to 14 A between redox centres through the protein medium. Transfer over longer distances always involves a chain of cofactors. This redox centre proximity alone is sufficient to allow tunnelling of electrons at rates far faster than the substrate redox reactions it supports. Consequently, there has been no necessity for proteins to evolve optimized routes between redox centres. Instead, simple geometry enables rapid tunnelling to high-energy intermediate states. This greatly simplifies any analysis of redox protein mechanisms and challenges the need to postulate mechanisms of superexchange through redox centres or the maintenance of charge neutrality when investigating electron-transfer reactions. Such tunnelling also allows sequential electron transfer in catalytic sites to surmount radical transition states without involving the movement of hydride ions, as is generally assumed. The 14 A or less spacing of redox centres provides highly robust engineering for electron transfer, and may reflect selection against designs that have proved more vulnerable to mutations during the course of evolution.},

abstract = {We have identified independently folding units, so called "foldons", from non-homologous proteins representing different folds. We applied simple statistical arguments in order to estimate the size of the foldon universe required to construct all foldable proteins. Various alignment procedures yield about 2600 foldons in the natural protein universe but this estimate is shown to be rather sensitive to the chosen cut-off value for structural similarity. We showed that foldon matching-modelling can reproduce the major part of the main chain of several proteins with a structural similarity measure Q-score of about 0.4 and an r.m.s. error of about 5 A, although the accuracy of structure prediction has been limited so far by the small size of foldon data set. The prediction score may be increased if one uses the set of protein fragments with optimized sequence-structure relationships, in other works, minimally frustrated segments. To quantify the degree of frustration of the structures of foldons from our database, we searched for those foldons which recognize their own sequence and structure upon threading. As a result we found that about half of the foldons from our data set recognize themselves as the best choice upon threading and therefore are individually minimally frustrated. We showed that there is a close connection between the Q-score of self recognition and the relative foldability (Theta) of the folding units. Foldons having high Q-score and Theta values are expected to be formed in the early phase of the folding process and be observed as stable intermediates under appropriate experimental conditions.},

We review the motivations, methods, and caveats of MSMs, as well as some recent highlights of applications of the method.

However, current theories often resort to rather heavy mathematics to overcome some technical difficulties inherent in the problem or start from a phenomenological model. To this end, we take a new approach in this pedagogical review of the statistical mechanics of protein folding. The benefit of our approach is a drastic mathematical simplification of the theory, without resort to any new approximations or phenomenological prescriptions. Indeed, the results we obtain agree precisely with previous calculations. Because of this simplification, we are able to present here a thorough and self contained treatment of the problem. Topics discussed include the statistical mechanics of the random energy model (REM), tests of the validity of REM as a model for heteropolymer freezing, freezing transition of random sequences, phase diagram of designed ("minimally frustrated") sequences, and the degree to which errors in the interactions employed in simulations of either folding and design can still lead to correct folding behavior.},

abstract = {In addition to being associated with severe degenerative diseases, amyloids show exceptional mechanical properties including great strength, sturdiness and elasticity. However, thus far physical models that explain these properties remain elusive, and our understanding of molecular deformation and failure mechanisms of individual amyloid fibrils is limited. Here we report a series of molecular dynamics simulations, carried out to analyze the mechanical response of two-fold symmetric Abeta(1-40) amyloid fibrils, twisted protein nanofilaments consisting of a H-bonded layered structure. We find a correlation of the mechanical behavior with chemical and nanostructural rearrangements of the fibril during compressive and tensile deformation, showing that the density of H-bonds varies linearly with the measured strain. Further, we find that both compressive and tensile deformation is coupled with torsional deformation, which is manifested in a strong variation of the interlayer twist angle that is found to be proportional to both the applied stress and measured strain. In both compression and tension we observe an increase of the Young's modulus from 2.34 GPa (for less than 0.1\% strain in compression and 0.2\% strain in tension), to 12.43 GPa for compression and 18.05 GPa for tension. The moduli at larger deformation are in good agreement with experimental data, where values in the range of 10-20 GPa have been reported. Our studies confirm that amyloids feature a very high stiffness, and elucidate the importance of the chemical and structural rearrangements of the fibrils during deformation.},

abstract = {The identification of more efficient therapies for defeating severe degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's is a major goal of drug discovery research. Realizing this ambitious goal will likely require a series of molecular insights that shed light on the fundamental mechanisms that drive the formation, growth, stability, and toxicity of A$\beta$(1-40) amyloid fibrils, one of the most abundant species found in affected brain tissues and potentially a major player in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid fibrils feature a highly ordered and dense network of hydrogen bonds, a universal feature of all amyloid structures, which is realized by a highly regular stacking of small $\beta$-units that are each stabilized by an intrapeptide salt bridge. Here we report a series of molecular dynamics simulations of large-scale amyloid fibrils with local mutations that result in the disruption of the key intrapeptide salt bridge. We demonstrate that mutations, through alterations in the nature of the salt bridge, have a significant effect on the geometry and mechanical properties of the amyloid fibril. We specifically observe a severe decrease in amyloid fibril periodicity (the period length) of up to 43\%, and extreme variations of the Young's modulus (a measure of the fibril's mechanical stiffness) of up to 154\%. These results confirm that, while on one hand side chains are not involved in the formation of the $\beta$-strands composing the inner core of the amyloid structure, their presence, size, and interactions can be crucial in determining the larger-scale properties of amyloid fibrils. Our results imply that interactions mediated by side chains could be a potential target for novel approaches to drug design and the development of molecular therapies for amyloid disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, through the chemical deactivation of key functional groups that are responsible for promoting the growth of the fibrils, for promoting their chemical and mechanical stability, and for furthering their aggregation in amyloid plaques.},

A physically motivated, nonpairwise-additive model of water-mediated interactions added to a protein structure prediction Hamiltonian yields marked improvement in the quality of structure prediction for larger proteins. Free energy profile analysis suggests that long-range water-mediated potentials guide folding and smooth the underlying folding funnel. Analyzing simulation trajectories gives direct evidence that water-mediated interactions facilitate native-like packing of supersecondary structural elements. Long-range pairing of hydrophilic groups is an integral part of protein architecture. Specific water-mediated interactions are a universal feature of biomolecular recognition landscapes in both folding and binding.},

We find that water-mediated interactions greatly complement direct interactions in discriminating against various types of trap interactions that model those present in the cell. We highlight the context dependent nature of knowledge-based binding potentials, as contrasted with the situation for autonomous folding. By performing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the corresponding interaction matrixes, we rationalize the strength of the recognition signal for each combination of the contact type and reference trap states using the differential in the idealized "canonical" amino acid compositions of native and trap layers. The comparison of direct and water-mediated contact potential matrixes emphasizes the importance of partial solvation in stabilizing charged groups in the protein interfaces. Specific water-mediated interresidue interactions are expected to influence significantly the kinetics as well as thermodynamics of protein association.},

Only intrachain interactions are considered, including one adjustable parameter, a favorable backbone energy (e.g., a peptide hydrogen bond). The counting is used to reevaluate Flory's isolated-pair hypothesis, the simplifying assumption that each phi,psi pair is sterically independent. This hypothesis is a conceptual linchpin in helix-coil theories and protein folding. Contrary to the hypothesis, we find that systematic local steric effects can extend beyond nearest-chain neighbors and can restrict the size of accessible conformational space significantly. As a result, the entropy price that must be paid to adopt any specific conformation is far less than previously thought.},

Energy landscape theory indicates that it is much easier to find sequences that satisfy the "Principle of Minimal Frustration" when the folded structure is symmetric (Wolynes, P. G. Symmetry and the Energy Landscapes of Biomolecules. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996, 93, 14249-14255). Similarly, repeats and structural mosaics may be fundamentally related to landscapes with multiple embedded funnels. Here we present analytical tools to detect and compare structural repetitions in protein molecules. By an exhaustive analysis of the distribution of structural repeats using a robust metric, we define those portions of a protein molecule that best describe the overall structure as a tessellation of basic units. The patterns produced by such tessellations provide intuitive representations of the repeating regions and their association toward higher order arrangements. We find that some protein architectures can be described as nearly periodic, while in others clear separations between repetitions exist. Since the method is independent of amino acid sequence information, we can identify structural units that can be encoded by a variety of distinct amino acid sequences.},

Simulations are used to sample the folding/unfolding free energy difference and its derivatives along 2 isochores. We model the DeltaG(u)(P,T) landscape using the simulation data and propose a stability diagram model for Trp-cage. We find the proposed diagram to exhibit features similar to globular proteins with increasing hydrostatic pressure destabilizing the native fold. The observed energy differences DeltaE(u) are roughly linearly temperature-dependent and approach DeltaE(u) = 0 with decreasing temperature, suggesting that the system approached the region of cold denaturation. In the low-temperature denatured state, the native helical secondary structure elements are largely preserved, whereas the protein conformation changes to an "open-clamp" configuration. A tighter packing of water around nonpolar sites, accompanied by an increasing solvent-accessible surface area of the unfolded ensemble, seems to stabilize the unfolded state at elevated pressures.},

abstract = {Cytoskeletal proteins belonging to the spectrin family have an elongated structure composed of repetitive units. The three-dimensional solution structure of the 16th repeat from chicken brain alpha-spectrin (R16) has been determined by NMR spectroscopy and distance geometry-simulated annealing calculations. We used a total of 1035 distance restraints, which included 719 NOE-based values obtained by applying the ambiguous restraints for iterative assignment (ARIA) method. In addition, we performed a direct refinement against 1H-chemical shifts. The final ensemble of 20 structures shows an average RMSD of 1.52 A from the mean for the backbone atoms, excluding loops and N and C termini. R16 is made up of three antiparallel alpha-helices separated by two loops, and folds into a left-handed coiled-coil. The basic unit of spectrin is an antiparallel heterodimer composed of two homologous chains, beta and alpha. These assemble a tetramer via a mechanism that relies on the completion of a single repeat by association of the partial repeats located at the C terminus of the beta-chain (two helices) and at the N terminus of the alpha-chain (one helix). This tetramer is the assemblage able to cross-link actin filaments. Model building by homology of the "tetramerization" repeat from human erythrocyte spectrin illuminates the possible role of point mutations which cause hemolytic anemias.},

abstract = {The unfolded ensemble in aqueous solution represents the starting point of protein folding. Characterisation of this species is often difficult since the native state is usually predominantly populated at equilibrium. Previous work has shown that the four-helix protein, Im7 (immunity protein 7), folds via an on-pathway intermediate. While the transition states and folding intermediate have been characterised in atomistic detail, knowledge of the unfolded ensemble under the same ambient conditions remained sparse. Here, we introduce destabilising amino acid substitutions into the sequence of Im7, such that the unfolded state becomes predominantly populated at equilibrium in the absence of denaturant. Using far- and near-UV CD, fluorescence, urea titration and heteronuclear NMR experiments, we show that three amino acid substitutions (L18A-L19A-L37A) are sufficient to prevent Im7 folding, such that the unfolded state is predominantly populated at equilibrium. Using measurement of chemical shifts, (15)N transverse relaxation rates and sedimentation coefficients, we show that the unfolded species of L18A-L19A-L37A deviates significantly from random-coil behaviour. Specifically, we demonstrate that this unfolded species is compact (R(h)=25 \AA) relative to the urea-denatured state (R(h)≥30 \AA) and contains local clusters of hydrophobic residues in regions that correspond to the four helices in the native state. Despite these interactions, there is no evidence for long-range stabilising tertiary interactions or persistent helical structure. The results reveal an unfolded ensemble that is conformationally restricted in regions of the polypeptide chain that ultimately form helices I, II and IV in the native state.},

abstract = {We present a protein engineering analysis of the fibrillation of a protein from a thermophilic organism, the 101 residue S6 from Thermus thermophilus. When agitated, S6 fibrillates at pH 2.0 in 0.4 M NaCl. Under these solvent conditions, S6 has native-like secondary structure and also unfolds and refolds cooperatively. However, its tertiary structure appears to be more plastic than at neutral pH, and some regions of the protein may be partially unstructured. At 42??C, there is a lag phase of several days after which fibrillation takes place over several hours. Data from the fibrillation behaviour of a comprehensive series of single and double mutants of S6 suggests that several factors control the onset of fibrillation. Firstly, there appears to be a contiguous region of "gatekeeper" residues that inhibit fibrillation, since their truncation significantly reduces the duration of the lag phase. This region overlaps extensively with the partially unstructured region of the protein, suggesting that residues with enhanced flexibility and solvent-accessibility are important for the initiation of fibrillation. Secondly, longer lag phases correlate with faster rates of unfolding. We interpret this to mean that kinetic stability also controls fibrillation but in the sense that the quasi-native state, rather than the denatured state, is the species that participates in nucleation. This implies that fibrillation can also occur from a quasi-native state as opposed to an ensemble of highly fluctuating structures, and highlights the delicate balance between flexibility and structure required to form organized assemblies of polypeptide chains. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The lack of understanding of amyloid fibril formation at the molecular level is a major obstacle in devising strategies to interfere with the pathologies linked to peptide or protein aggregation. In particular, little is known on the role of intermediates and fibril elongation pathways as well as their dependence on the intrinsic tendency of a polypeptide chain to self-assembly by ??-sheet formation (??-aggregation propensity). Here, coarse-grained simulations of an amphipathic polypeptide show that a decrease in the ??-aggregation propensity results in a larger heterogeneity of elongation pathways, despite the essentially identical structure of the final fibril. Protofibrillar intermediates that are thinner, shorter and less structured than the final fibril accumulate along some of these pathways. Moreover, the templated formation of an additional protofilament on the lateral surface of a protofibril is sometimes observed as a collective transition. Conversely, for a polypeptide model with a high ??-aggregation propensity, elongation proceeds without protofibrillar intermediates. Therefore, changes in intrinsic ??-aggregation propensity modulate the relative accessibility of parallel routes of aggregation. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Protein tertiary structures are known to be encoded in amino acid sequences, but the problem of structure prediction from sequence continues to be a challenge. With this question in mind, recent simulations have shown that atomic burials, as expressed by atom distances to the molecular geometrical center, are sufficiently informative for determining native conformations of small globular proteins. Here we use a simple computational experiment to estimate the amount of this required burial information and find it to be surprisingly small, actually comparable with the stringent limit imposed by sequence statistics. Atomic burials appear to satisfy, therefore, minimal requirements for a putative dominating property in the folding code because they provide an amount of information sufficiently large for structural determination but, at the same time, sufficiently small to be encodable in sequences. In a simple analogy with human communication, atomic burials could correspond to the actual "language" encoded in the amino acid "script" from which the complexity of native conformations is recovered during the folding process.},

abstract = {Ascaris hemoglobin consists of 8 subunits, each of which contains a C-terminal peptide with the sequence Glu-Glu-Lys-His repeated 4 times. When plotted on a beta-strand, this sequence leads to alternate lysines and glutamates on one side of the strand, and alternate glutamates and histidines on the other side, suggestive of a polar zipper that links the subunits together. A computer search of the protein database showed that the same or similar sequences also occur in other proteins. Some contain long repeats of Asp-Arg or Glu-Arg, among them the small nuclear ribonucleo-U1 70K protein, which is an autoantigen in systemic lupus erythematosis. These repeats appear to constitute the dominant epitopes in the autoimmune reaction. Single chains with Asp-Arg repeats may form alpha-helices in which alternate positively charged ridges and negatively charged grooves compensate each other. Several separate chains with Asp-Arg repeats could compensate each other's charges optimally by zipping together to beta-sheets. Several homeodomains of Drosophila, as well as the human transcription factor SP1, contain repeats of glutamines. Molecular modeling, circular dichroism, and electron and X-ray diffraction studies of a synthetic poly(L-glutamine) showed that it forms beta-sheets held together by hydrogen bonds between the main-chain and side-chain amides. Published data suggest that the function of these glutamine repeats consists of joining essential transcription factors bound to distant segments of DNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {A study of papers on amyloid fibers suggested to us that cylindrical $\beta$-sheets are the only structures consistent with some of the x-ray and electron microscope data. We then found that our own 7-year-old and hitherto enigmatic x-ray diagram of poly-l-glutamine fits a cylindrical sheet of 31 \AA diameter made of $\beta$-strands with 20 residues per helical turn. Successive turns are linked by hydrogen bonds between both the main chain and side chain amides, and side chains point alternately into and out of the cylinder. Fibers of the exon-1 peptide of huntingtin and of the glutamine- and asparagine-rich region of the yeast prion Sup35 give the same underlying x-ray diagrams, which show that they have the same structure. Electron micrographs show that the 100-\AA-thick fibers of the Sup35 peptide are ropes made of three protofibrils a little over 30 \AA thick. They have a measured mass of 1,450 Da/\AA, compared with 1,426 Da/\AA for a calculated mass of three protofibrils each with 20 residues per helical turn wound around each other with a helical pitch of 510 \AA. Published x-ray diagrams and electron micrographs show that fibers of synuclein, the protein that forms the aggregates of Parkinson disease, consist of single cylindrical $\beta$-sheets. Fibers of Alzheimer A$\beta$ fragments and variants are probably made of either two or three concentric cylindrical $\beta$-sheets. Our structure of poly-l-glutamine fibers may explain why, in all but one of the neurodegenerative diseases resulting from extension of glutamine repeats, disease occurs when the number of repeats exceeds 37–40. A single helical turn with 20 residues would be unstable, because there is nothing to hold it in place, but two turns with 40 residues are stabilized by the hydrogen bonds between their amides and can act as nuclei for further helical growth. The A$\beta$ peptide of Alzheimer's disease contains 42 residues, the best number for nucleating further growth. All these structures are very stable; the best hope for therapies lies in preventing their growth.},

abstract = {The 37-residue Formin-binding protein, FBP28, is a canonical three-stranded beta-sheet WW domain. Because of its small size, it is so insensitive to chemical denaturation that it is barely possible to determine accurately a denaturation curve, as the transition spans 0-7 M guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmCl). It is also only marginally stable, with a free energy of denaturation of just 2.3 kcal/mol at 10 degrees Celsius so only small changes in energy upon mutation can be tolerated. But these properties and relaxation times for folding of 25 micros-400 micros conspire to allow the rapid acquisition of accurate and reproducible kinetic data for Phi-analysis using classical temperature-jump methods. The transition state for folding is highly polarized with some regions having Phi-values of 0 and others 1, as readily seen in chevron plots, with Phi-values of 0 having the refolding arms overlaying and those of 1 the unfolding arms superimposable. Good agreement is seen with transition state structures identified from independent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at 60, 75, and 100 degrees Celsius, which allows us to explore further the details of the folding and unfolding pathway of FBP28. The first beta-turn is near native-like in the transition state for folding (experimental) and unfolding (MD and experiment). The simulations show that there are transient contacts between the aromatic side-chains of the beta-strands in the denatured state and that these interactions provide the driving force for folding of the first beta-hairpin of this three-stranded sheet. Only after the backbone hydrogen bonds are formed between beta1 and beta2 does a hydrogen bond form to stabilize the intervening turn, or the first beta-turn.},

NAMD works with AMBER and CHARMM potential functions, parameters, and file formats. This article, directed to novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature and pressure controls used. Features for steering the simulation across barriers and for calculating both alchemical and conformational free energy differences are presented. The motivations for and a roadmap to the internal design of NAMD, implemented in C++ and based on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined. The factors affecting the serial and parallel performance of a simulation are discussed. Finally, typical NAMD use is illustrated with representative applications to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular system, highlighting particular features of NAMD, for example, the Tcl scripting language. The article also provides a list of the key features of NAMD and discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular graphics/sequence analysis software VMD and the grid computing/collaboratory software BioCoRE.

The quantitative comparison of simulation results with various forms of experimental data probing different aspects of the folding process can facilitate robust assessment of the accuracy of the calculations while providing a detailed structural interpretation for the experimental observations. In the example studied here, the analysis of folding rates, $\Phi$-values, and folding pathways provides support for the notion that a norleucine double mutant of villin folds five times faster than the wild-type sequence, but following a slightly different pathway. This work showcases how computer simulation has now developed into a mature tool for the quantitative computational study of protein folding and dynamics that can provide a valuable complement to experimental techniques.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations hold the promise of providing an atomic-level description of protein folding that cannot easily be obtained from experiments. Here, we examine the extent to which the molecular mechanics force field used in such simulations might influence the observed folding pathways. To that end, we performed equilibrium simulations of a fast-folding variant of the villin headpiece using four different force fields. In each simulation, we observed a large number of transitions between the unfolded and folded states, and in all four cases, both the rate of folding and the structure of the native state were in good agreement with experiments. We found, however, that the folding mechanism and the properties of the unfolded state depend substantially on the choice of force field. We thus conclude that although it is important to match a single, experimentally determined structure and folding rate, this does not ensure that a given simulation will provide a unique and correct description of the full free-energy surface and the mechanism of folding.},

Fast-folding proteins with low free-energy barriers have proved to be particularly productive objects of investigation in this context, but the design of fast-folding proteins was previously driven largely by experiment. Dramatic advances in the attainable length of molecular dynamics simulations have allowed us to characterize in atomic-level detail the folding mechanism of the fast-folding all-$\beta$ WW domain FiP35. In the work reported here, we applied the biophysical insights gained from these studies to computationally design an even faster-folding variant of FiP35 containing only naturally occurring amino acids. The increased stability and high folding rate predicted by our simulations were subsequently validated by temperature-jump experiments. The experimentally measured folding time was 4.3 $\mu$s at 80 °C-about three times faster than the fastest previously known protein with $\beta$-sheet content and in good agreement with our prediction. These results provide a compelling demonstration of the potential utility of very long molecular dynamics simulations in redesigning proteins well beyond their evolved stability and folding speed.},

abstract = {Dynamic protein interactions play a significant part in many cellular processes. A technique that shows considerable promise in elucidating such interactions is F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). When combined with multiple, colored fluorescent proteins, FRET permits high spatial resolution assays of protein-protein interactions in living cells. Because FRET signals are usually small, however, their measurement requires careful interpretation and several control experiments. Nevertheless, the use of FRET in cell biological experiments has exploded over the past few years. Here we describe the physical basis of FRET and the fluorescent proteins appropriate for these experiments. We also review the approaches that can be used to measure FRET, with particular emphasis on the potential artifacts associated with each approach.},

abstract = {Theoretical studies have suggested relationships between the size, stability and topology of a protein fold and the rate and mechanisms by which it is achieved. The recent characterization of the refolding of a number of simple, single domain proteins has provided a means of testing these assertions. Our investigations have revealed statistically significant correlations between the average sequence separation between contacting residues in the native state and the rate and transition state placement of folding for a non-homologous set of simple, single domain proteins. These indicate that proteins featuring primarily sequence-local contacts tend to fold more rapidly and exhibit less compact folding transition states than those characterized by more non-local interactions. No significant relationship is apparent between protein length and folding rates, but a weak correlation is observed between length and the fraction of solvent-exposed surface area buried in the transition state. Anticipated strong relationships between equilibrium folding free energy and folding kinetics, or between chemical denaturant and temperature dependence-derived measures of transition state placement, are not apparent. The observed correlations are consistent with a model of protein folding in which the size and stability of the polypeptide segments organized in the transition state are largely independent of protein length, but are related to the topological complexity of the native state. The correlation between topological complexity and folding rates may reflect chain entropy contributions to the folding barrier.},

Glutamate receptors that mediate excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain show unusual sensitivity to external ions, resulting in an apparent requirement for sodium in order for glutamate to activate kainate receptors. Here, we solve the structure of the Na(+)-binding sites and determine the mechanism by which allosteric anions and cations regulate ligand-binding dimer stability, and hence the rate of desensitization and receptor availability for gating by glutamate. We establish a stoichiometry for binding of 2 Na(+) to 1 Cl(-) and show that allosteric anions and cations bind at physically discrete sites with strong electric fields, that the binding sites are not saturated in CSF, and that the requirement of kainate receptors for Na(+) occurs simply because other cations bind with lower affinity and have lower efficacy compared to Na(+).},

abstract = {We use a free energy functional theory to elucidate general properties of heterogeneously ordering, fast folding proteins, and we test our conclusions with lattice simulations. We find that both structural and energetic heterogeneity can lower the free energy barrier to folding. Correlating stronger contact energies with entropically likely contacts of a given native structure lowers the barrier, and anticorrelating the energies has the reverse effect. Designing in relatively mild energetic heterogeneity can eliminate the barrier completely at the transition temperature. Sequences with native energies tuned to fold uniformly, as well as sequences tuned to fold reliably by a single or a few routes, are rare. Sequences with weak native energetic heterogeneity are more common; their folding kinetics is more strongly determined by properties of the native structure. Sequences with different distributions of stability throughout the protein may still be good folders to the same structure. A measure of folding route narrowness is introduced that correlates with rate and that can give information about the intrinsic biases in ordering arising from native topology. This theoretical framework allows us to investigate systematically the coupled effects of energy and topology in protein folding and to interpret recent experiments that investigate these effects.},

abstract = {The energy landscapes of proteins have evolved to be different from most random heteropolymers. Many studies have concluded that evolutionary selection for rapid and reliable folding to a given structure that is stable at biological temperatures leads to energy landscapes having a single dominant basin and an overall funnel topography. We show here that, although such a landscape topography is indeed a sufficient condition for folding, another possibility also exists, giving a previously undescribed class of foldable sequences. These sequences have landscapes that are only weakly funneled in the conventional thermodynamic sense but have unusually low kinetic barriers for reconfigurational motion. Traps have been specifically removed by selection. Here we examine the possibility of folding on these "buffed" landscapes by mapping the determination of statistics of pathways for the heterogeneous nucleation processes involved in escaping from traps to the solution of an imaginary time Schroedinger equation. This equation is solved analytically in adiabatic and "soft-wall" approximations, and numerical results are shown for the general case. The fraction of funneled vs. buffed proteins in sequence space is estimated, suggesting the statistical dominance of the funneling mechanism for achieving foldability.},

To address this problem, we have developed a simple, fast, and accurate approximation for calculating Born radii in the context of protein design calculations. When these approximate Born radii are used with the generalized Born continuum dielectric model, energies calculated by the 106-fold slower finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann model are faithfully reproduced. A similar approach can be used for estimating solvent-accessible surface areas (SASAs).

To address this problem, we have developed a simple, fast, and accurate approximation for calculating Born radii in the context of protein design calculations. When these approximate Born radii are used with the generalized Born continuum dielectric model, energies calculated by the 106-fold slower finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann model are faithfully reproduced. A similar approach can be used for estimating solvent-accessible surface areas (SASAs). As an independent test, we show that these approximations can be used to accurately predict the experimentally determined pKas of >200 ionizable groups from 15 proteins.},

abstract = {N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) channels mediate the slow component of excitatory potentials at glutamatergic synapses. They have complex kinetic behavior, and much remains to be understood about NMDAR gating mechanisms and the molecular events that shape the synaptic current. Here we show that an individual NMDAR produces at least three stable patterns of activity. For all modes, channels gate by the same mechanism and can occupy either of two open states. The relative stability of the open states differs across modes because of a common perturbation to the NMDAR structure that may be subject to cellular control. Simulations indicate that native NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses arise mainly from the most common mode, and that the slow rise and decay of the current can be attributed to multiple transitions between fully liganded open and closed states rather than to agonist dissociation.},

abstract = {Thirty-three years have elapsed since the first membrane protein (MP) was brought back in vitro to its native state starting from the completely unfolded polypeptide. Folding MPs is as useful from a practical point of view as it is thought-provoking from a theoretical one. Yet, this activity is considered as a high-risk, time-consuming endeavor, full of pitfalls, its path littered with the broken careers of graduate students sacrificed on the altar of a long shot that never paid off. In fact, a surprisingly high number of MPs have actually been folded or refolded in vitro. Analysis of the literature indicates i)that the endeavor is not as desperate as it may seem, ii)that techniques are diversifying and improving, and iii)that many MPs do not need the cellular biosynthetic apparatus, nor even a membrane environment, to reach a functional 3D structure. A compilation, hopefully close to complete, is presented of MPs that have been (re)folded in vitro to-date, with the conditions of their synthesis, the denaturant(s) used, if any, and the (re)folding conditions, along with a few comments. The hope is that this analysis will encourage membrane protein biochemists to consider producing their target proteins in this way, help them decide about an experimental course, and stimulate the reflection about which environments favor membrane protein folding and why.},

abstract = {Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are synaptic proteins that facilitate signal transmission in the central nervous system. Extracellular iGluR cleft closure is linked to receptor activation; however, the mechanism underlying partial agonism is not entirely understood. Full agonists close the bilobed ligand-binding domain (LBD), while antagonists prevent closure; the transmembrane ion channel either opens or stays closed, respectively. Although some bulky partial agonists produce intermediate iGluR-LBD closure, the available crystal structures also imply that the cleft can be shut with certain partial agonists. Recently, we have shown that the iGluR-LBD closure stage can be recreated by inserting a ligand into the closed cleft and simulating the ligand-receptor complex with molecular dynamics. Our simulations indicate that partial agonist binding does not necessarily prevent full receptor cleft closure; instead, it destabilizes cleft closure. Interdomain hydrogen bonds were studied thoroughly, and one hydrogen bond, in particular, was consistently disrupted by bound partial agonists. Accordingly, the simulation protocol presented here can be used to categorize compounds in silico as partial or full agonists for iGluRs.},

The presented approach is tailor-made for molecular systems where atomistic resolution is required only in spatially localized domains whereas a lower mesoscopic level of detail is sufficient for the rest of the system. Our method allows an on-the-fly interchange between a given molecule's atomic and coarse-grained levels of description, enabling us to reach large length and time scales while spatially retaining atomistic details of the system. The new approach is tested on a model system of a liquid of tetrahedral molecules. The simulation box is divided into two regions: one containing only atomistically resolved tetrahedral molecules, and the other containing only one-particle coarse-grained spherical molecules. The molecules can freely move between the two regions while changing their level of resolution accordingly. The hybrid and the atomistically resolved systems have the same statistical properties at the same physical conditions.},

This all implies a thorough understanding on many length and correspondingly time scales, ranging from (sub)atomistic to macroscopic. Presently, computer simulations play an increasingly important, if not central, role. Some problems do not require specific atomistic details, whereas others require them only locally. However, in many cases this strict separation is not sufficient for a comprehensive understanding of systems, and flexible simulation schemes are required that link the different levels of resolution. We here give a general view of the problem regarding soft matter and discuss some specific examples of linked simulation techniques at different resolution levels. We then discuss a recently developed flexible simulation scheme, the AdResS method, which allows one to adaptively change the resolution in certain regions of space on demand.},

In the present contribution we show how basin-hopping global optimization can identify low-lying minima for the corresponding mildly frustrated energy landscapes. For small systems the basin-hopping algorithm succeeds in locating both lower minima and conformations closer to the experimental structure than does molecular dynamics with simulated annealing. For large systems the efficiency of basin-hopping decreases for our initial implementation, where the steps consist of random perturbations to the Cartesian coordinates. We implemented umbrella sampling using basin-hopping to further confirm when the global minima are reached. We have also improved the energy surface by employing bioinformatic techniques for reducing the roughness or variance of the energy surface. Finally, the basin-hopping calculations have guided improvements in the excluded volume of the Hamiltonian, producing better structures. These results suggest a novel and transferable optimization scheme for future energy function development.},

abstract = {The reaction pathways characterizing macromolecular systems of biological interest are associated with high free energy barriers. Resorting to the standard all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) to explore such critical regions may be inappropriate as the time needed to observe the relevant transitions can be remarkably long. In this paper, we present a new method called Extended Diffusion-Map-directed Molecular Dynamics (extended DM-d-MD) used to enhance the sampling of MD trajectories in such a way as to rapidly cover all important regions of the free energy landscape including deep metastable states and critical transition paths. Moreover, extended DM-d-MD was combined with a reweighting scheme enabling to save on-the-fly information about the Boltzmann distribution. Our algorithm was successfully applied to two systems, alanine dipeptide and alanine-12. Due to the enhanced sampling, the Boltzmann distribution is recovered much faster than in plain MD simulations. For alanine dipeptide, we report a speedup of one order of magnitude with respect to plain MD simulations. For alanine-12, our algorithm allows us to highlight all important unfolded basins in several days of computation when one single misfolded event is barely observable within the same amount of computational time by plain MD simulations. Our method is reaction coordinate free, shows little dependence on the a priori knowledge of the system, and can be implemented in such a way that the biased steps are not computationally expensive with respect to MD simulations thus making our approach well adapted for larger complex systems from which little information is known.},

abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) can be coupled with Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to detect intramolecular dynamics of proteins on the microsecond time scale. Here we describe application of FRET-FCS to detect fluctuations within the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the Ca(2+)-signaling protein calmodulin. Intramolecular fluctuations were resolved by global fitting of the two fluorescence autocorrelation functions (green-green and red-red) together with the two cross-correlation functions (green-red and red-green). To match the Förster radius for FRET to the dimensions of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, a near-infrared acceptor fluorophore (Atto 740) was coupled with a green-emitting donor (Alexa Fluor 488). Fluctuations were detected in both domains on the time scale of 30 to 40 $\mu$s. In the N-terminal domain, the amplitude of the fluctuations was dependent on occupancy of Ca(2+) binding sites. A high amplitude of dynamics in apo-calmodulin (in the absence of Ca(2+)) was nearly abolished at a high Ca(2+) concentration. For the C-terminal domain, the dynamic amplitude changed little with Ca(2+) concentration. The Ca(2+) dependence of dynamics for the N-terminal domain suggests that the fluctuations detected by FCS in the N-terminal domain are coupled to the opening and closing of the EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding loops.},

abstract = {Go-type potentials, based on the inter-residue contacts present in the native structure of a protein, are frequently used to predict dynamic and structural features of the folding pathways through computer simulations. However, the mathematical form used to define the model interactions includes several arbitrary choices, whose consequences are not usually analyzed. In this work, we use a simple off-lattice protein model and a parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulation technique to carry out such analysis, centered in the thermodynamic characteristics of the folding transition. We show how the definition of a native contact has a deep impact on the presence of simple or complex transitions, with or without thermodynamic intermediates. In addition, we have checked that the width of the attractive wells has a profound effect on the free-energy barrier between the folded and unfolded states, mainly through its influence on the entropy of the denatured state.},

abstract = {The relative importance of local and long range interactions in the characteristics of the protein folding process has long been a matter of controversy. Computer simulations based on Gō-type models have been widely used to study this topic, but without much agreement on which type of interactions is more relevant for the foldability of a protein. In this work, the authors also employ a topology-based potential and simulation model to analyze the influence of local and long range interactions on the thermodynamics of the folding transition. The former are mainly used to control the degree of flexibility (or stiffness) of the chain, mostly appreciable in the unfolded (noncompact) state. Our results show the different effects that local and nonlocal interactions have on the entropy and the energy of the system. This implies that a balance between both types of interactions is required, so that a free energy barrier exists between the native and the denatured states. The variations in the contribution of both types of interactions have also a direct effect on the stability of the chain conformations, including the possible appearance of thermodynamic folding intermediates.},

Here we sketch our current perspective of Markov models and explain in short their theoretical basis and assumptions. We describe transition path theory which allows the entire ensemble of protein folding pathways to be investigated and that combines naturally with Markov models. Experimental observations can be naturally linked to Markov models with the dynamical fingerprint theory, by which experimentally observable timescales can be equipped with an understanding of the structural rearrangement processes that take place at these timescales. The concepts of this paper are illustrated by a simple kinetic model of protein folding.},

abstract = {Markov state models of molecular kinetics (MSMs), in which the long-time statistical dynamics of a molecule is approximated by a Markov chain on a discrete partition of configuration space, have seen widespread use in recent years. This approach has many appealing characteristics compared to straightforward molecular dynamics simulation and analysis, including the potential to mitigate the sampling problem by extracting long-time kinetic information from short trajectories and the ability to straightforwardly calculate expectation values and statistical uncertainties of various stationary and dynamical molecular observables. In this paper, we summarize the current state of the art in generation and validation of MSMs and give some important new results. We describe an upper bound for the approximation error made by modeling molecular dynamics with a MSM and we show that this error can be made arbitrarily small with surprisingly little effort. In contrast to previous practice, it becomes clear that the best MSM is not obtained by the most metastable discretization, but the MSM can be much improved if non-metastable states are introduced near the transition states. Moreover, we show that it is not necessary to resolve all slow processes by the state space partitioning, but individual dynamical processes of interest can be resolved separately. We also present an efficient estimator for reversible transition matrices and a robust test to validate that a MSM reproduces the kinetics of the molecular dynamics data.},

It is shown that the partial heat capacity of denatured protein significantly exceeds the heat capacity of native protein, especially in the case of globular proteins, and is close to the value calculated for an extended polypeptide chain from the known heat capacities of individual amino acid residues. The significant residual structure that appears at room temperature in the denatured states of some globular proteins (e.g. myoglobin and lysozyme) at neutral pH results in a slight decrease of the heat capacity, probably due to partial screening of the protein non-polar groups from water. The heat capacity of the unfolded state increases asymptotically, approaching a constant value at about 100 degrees C. The temperature dependence of the heat capacity of the native state, which can be determined over a much shorter range of temperature than that of the denatured state and, correspondingly, is less certain, appears to be linear up to 80 degrees C. Therefore, the denaturational heat capacity increment seems to be temperature-dependent and is likely to decrease to zero at about 140 degrees C.},

abstract = {Under appropriate conditions, the four-helical Im7 (immunity protein 7) folds from an ensemble of unfolded conformers to a highly compact native state via an on-pathway intermediate. Here, we investigate the unfolded, intermediate, and native states populated during folding using diffusion single-pair fluorescence resonance energy transfer by measuring the efficiency of energy transfer (or proximity or P ratio) between pairs of fluorophores introduced into the side chains of cysteine residues placed in the center of helices 1 and 4, 1 and 3, or 2 and 4. We show that while the native states of each variant give rise to a single narrow distribution with high P values, the distributions of the intermediates trapped at equilibrium (denoted I(eqm)) are fitted by two Gaussian distributions. Modulation of the folding conditions from those that stabilize the intermediate to those that destabilize the intermediate enabled the distribution of lower P value to be assigned to the population of the unfolded ensemble in equilibrium with the intermediate state. The reduced stability of the I(eqm) variants allowed analysis of the effect of denaturant concentration on the compaction and breadth of the unfolded state ensemble to be quantified from 0 to 6 M urea. Significant compaction is observed as the concentration of urea is decreased in both the presence and absence of sodium sulfate, as previously reported for a variety of proteins. In the presence of Na(2)SO(4) in 0 M urea, the P value of the unfolded state ensemble approaches that of the native state. Concurrent with compaction, the ensemble displays increased peak width of P values, possibly reflecting a reduction in the rate of conformational exchange among iso-energetic unfolded, but compact conformations. The results provide new insights into the initial stages of folding of Im7 and suggest that the unfolded state is highly conformationally constrained at the outset of folding.},

abstract = {A full structural description of transition state ensembles in protein folding includes the specificity of the ordered residues composing the folding nucleus as well as spatial density. To our knowledge, the spatial properties of the folding nucleus and interface of specific nuclei have yet to receive significant attention. We analyze folding routes predicted by a variational model in terms of a generalized formalism of the capillarity scaling theory that assumes the volume of the folded core of the nucleus grows with chain length as V(f) approximately N(3nu). For 27 two-state proteins studied, the scaling exponent nu ranges from 0.2 to 0.45 with an average of 0.33. This average value corresponds to packing of rigid objects, although generally the effective monomer size in the folded core is larger than the corresponding volume per particle in the native-state ensemble. That is, on average, the folded core of the nucleus is found to be relatively diffuse. We also study the growth of the folding nucleus and interface along the folding route in terms of the density or packing fraction. The evolution of the folded core and interface regions can be classified into three patterns of growth depending on how the growth of the folded core is balanced by changes in density of the interface. Finally, we quantify the diffuse versus polarized structure of the critical nucleus through direct calculation of the packing fraction of the folded core and interface regions. Our results support the general picture of describing protein folding as the capillarity-like growth of folding nuclei.},

abstract = {A coarse-grained variational model is used to investigate the polymer dynamics of barrier crossing for a diverse set of two-state folding proteins. The model gives reliable folding rate predictions provided excluded volume terms that induce minor structural cooperativity are included in the interaction potential. In general, the cooperative folding routes have sharper interfaces between folded and unfolded regions of the folding nucleus and higher free energy barriers. The calculated free energy barriers are strongly correlated with native topology as characterized by contact order. Increasing the rigidity of the folding nucleus changes the local structure of the transition state ensemble nonuniformly across the set of proteins studied. Nevertheless, the calculated prefactors k(0) are found to be relatively uniform across the protein set, with variation in 1/k(0) less than a factor of 5. This direct calculation justifies the common assumption that the prefactor is roughly the same for all small two-state folding proteins. Using the barrier heights obtained from the model and the best-fit monomer relaxation time 30 ns, we find that 1/k(0) approximately 1-5 mus (with average 1/k(0) approximately 4 micros). This model can be extended to study subtle aspects of folding such as the variation of the folding rate with stability or solvent viscosity and the onset of downhill folding.},

abstract = {Protein folding is a diffusional process, and the speed of folding is controlled by the frictional forces that act on the polypeptide chain. Several previous studies have suggested that the bulk viscosity of the solvent is the only important source of friction in folding reactions. By contrast, our studies of the folding dynamics of the Tryptophan Cage, a small, ultrafast-folding protein, show clear evidence for additional frictional forces that are independent of the solvent viscosity. The nature of this internal friction appears qualitatively different for the folding vs. unfolding reactions. We expect that this phenomenon could significantly influence the rate of many folding processes that proceed on sufficiently fast (?????s) time scales. In particular, it may limit folding speeds to values substantially slower than the diffusion limits estimated from simple contact-formation studies in polypeptides. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Water motion at protein surfaces is fundamental to protein structure, stability, dynamics, and function. By using intrinsic tryptophans as local optical probes, and with femtosecond resolution, it is possible to probe surface-water motions in the hydration layer. Here, we report our studies of local hydration dynamics at the surface of the enzyme Staphylococcus nuclease using site-specific mutations. From these studies of the WT and four related mutants, which change local charge distribution and structure, we are able to ascertain the contribution to solvation by protein side chains as relatively insignificant. We determined the time scales of hydration to be 3-5 ps and 100-150 ps. The former is the result of local librational/rotational motions of water near the surface; the latter is a direct measure of surface hydration assisted by fluctuations of the protein. Experimentally, these hydration dynamics of the WT and the four mutants are also consistent with results of the total dynamic Stokes shifts and fluorescence emission maxima and are correlated with their local charge distribution and structure. We discuss the role of protein fluctuation on the time scale of labile hydration and suggest reexamination of recent molecular dynamics simulations.},

abstract = {The thermal stability of proteins was studied, 195 single amino acid residue replacements reported elsewhere being analysed for several protein conformational characteristics: type of residue replacement; conservative versus nonconservative substitution; replacement being in a homologous stretch of amino acid residues; change in hydrogen bond, van der Waals and secondary structure propensities; solvent-accessible versus inaccessible replacement; type of secondary structure involved in the substitution; the physico-chemical characteristics to which the thermostability enhancement can be attributed; and the relationship of the replacement site to the folding intermediates of the protein, when known. From the above analyses, some general rules arise which suggest where amino acid substitutions can be made to enhance protein thermostability: substitutions are conservative according to the Dayhoff matrix; mainly occur on conserved stretches of residues; preferentially occur on solvent-accessible residues; maintain or enhance the secondary structure propensity upon substitution; contribute to neutralize the dipole moment of the caps of helices and strands; and tend to increase the number of potential hydrogen bonding or van der Waals contacts or improve hydrophobic packing.},

abstract = {Wecompute the temperature-dependent barrier for $\alpha$-relaxationsin several liquids, without adjustable parameters, using experimentallydetermined elastic, structural, and calorimetric data. We employ therandom first order transition (RFOT) theory, in which relaxation occursvia activated reconfigurations between distinct, aperiodic minimaof the free energy. Two different approximations for the mismatchpenalty between the distinct aperiodic states are compared, one dueto Xia and Wolynes (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.2000,97, 2990), whichscales universally with temperature as for hard spheres, and one dueto Rabochiy and Lubchenko (J. Chem. Phys.2013, 138, 12A534), which employs measured elastic andstructural data for individual substances. The agreement between thepredictions and experiment is satisfactory, given the uncertaintyin the measured experimental inputs. The explicitly computed barriersare used to calculate the glass transition temperature for each substanceakinetic quantityfrom the static input data alone. The temperaturedependence of both the elastic and structural constants enters thetemperature dependence of the barrier over an extended range to adegree that varies from substance to substance. The lowering of theconfigurational entropy, however, seems to be the dominant contributorto the barrier increase near the laboratory glass transition, consistentwith previous experimental tests of the RFOT theory using the XW approximation.In addition, we compute the temperature dependence of the dynamicalcorrelation length, also without using adjustable parameters. Theseagree well with experimental estimates obtained using the Berthieret al. (Science2005, 310, 1797) procedure. Finally, we find the temperature dependence ofthe complexity of a rearranging region is consistent with the picturebased on the RFOT theory but is in conflict with the assumptions ofthe Adam–Gibbs and “shoving” scenarios for theviscous slowing down in supercooled liquids.

abstract = {A design strategy to control the thermally triggered folding, self-assembly, and subsequent hydrogelation of amphiphilic beta-hairpin peptides in a pH-dependent manner is presented. Point substitutions of the lysine residues of the self-assembling peptide MAX1 were made to alter the net charge of the peptide. In turn, the electrostatic nature of the peptide directly influences the solution pH at which thermally triggered hydrogelation is permitted. CD spectroscopy and oscillatory rheology show that peptides of lower net positive charge are capable of folding and assembling into hydrogel material at lower values of pH at a given temperature. The pH sensitive folding and assembling behavior is not only dependent on the net peptide charge, but also on the exact position of substitution within the peptide sequence. TEM shows that these peptides self-assemble into hydrogels that are composed of well-defined fibrils with nonlaminated morphologies. TEM also indicates that fibril morphology is not influenced by making these sequence changes on the hydrophilic face of the hairpins. Rheology shows that the ultimate mechanical rigidity of these peptide hydrogels is dependent on the rate of folding and self-assembly. Peptides that fold and assemble faster afford more rigid gels. Ultimately, this design strategy yielded a peptide MAX1(K15E) that is capable of undergoing thermally triggered hydrogelation at physiological buffer conditions (pH 7.4, 150 NaCl, 37 degrees C).},

Structures of the extracellular ligand-binding domain suggest that the extent of cleft closure in the ligand-binding domain controls the extent of activation of the receptor. Here we have developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based probe that allows us to study the extent of cleft closure in the isolated ligand-binding domain in solution. These investigations show that the wild-type protein exhibits a graded cleft closure that correlates to the extent of activation, which is in qualitative agreement with the crystal structures. However, the changes in extent of cleft closure between the apo and agonist-bound states are smaller than that observed in the crystal structures. We have also used this method to study the L650T mutant and show that in solution the alpha-amino-5-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-isoxazole propionate-bound form of this mutant exists primarily in a conformation that is more closed than predicted based on the activity, indicating that the degree of cleft closure alone cannot be used as a measure of extent of activation of the receptor, and there are possibly other mechanisms in addition to cleft closure that mediate the subtleties in extent of activation by a given agonist.},

abstract = {We have investigated the range of cleft closure conformational states that the agonist-binding domains of the $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors occupy when bound to a series of willardiine derivatives using single-molecule FRET. These studies show that the agonist-binding domain exhibits varying degrees of dynamics when bound to the different willardiines with differing efficacies. The chlorowillardiine- and nitrowillardiine-bound form of the agonist-binding domain probes a narrower range of cleft closure states relative to the iodowillardiine bound form of the protein, with the antagonist ($\alpha$S)-$\alpha$-amino-3-[(4-carboxyphenyl)methyl]-3,4-dihydro-2,4-dioxo-1(2H)-pyrimidinepropanoic acid (UBP-282)-bound form exhibiting the widest range of cleft closure states. Additionally, the average cleft closure follows the order UBP-282 > iodowillardiine > chlorowillardiine > nitrowillardiine-bound forms of agonist-binding domain. These single-molecule FRET data, along with our previously reported data for the glutamate-bound forms of wild type and T686S mutant proteins, show that the mean currents under nondesensitizing conditions can be directly correlated to the fraction of the agonist-binding domains in the "closed" cleft conformation. These results indicate that channel opening in the AMPA receptors is controlled by both the ability of the agonist to induce cleft closure and the dynamics of the agonist-binding domain when bound to the agonist.},

abstract = {To gain insight into the free energy changes accompanying protein hydrophobic core formation, we have used computer simulations to study the formation of small clusters of nonpolar solutes in water. A barrier to association is observed at the largest solute separation that does not allow substantial solvent penetration. The barrier reflects an effective increase in the size of the cavity occupied by the expanded but water-excluding cluster relative to both the close-packed cluster and the fully solvated separated solutes; a similar effect may contribute to the barrier to protein folding/unfolding. Importantly for the simulation of protein folding without explicit solvent, we find that the interactions between nonpolar solutes of varying size and number can be approximated by a linear function of the molecular surface, but not the solvent-accessible surface of the solutes. Comparison of the free energy of cluster formation to that of dimer formation suggests that the assumption of pair additivity implicit in current protein database derived potentials may be in error.},

abstract = {The elongation cycle of protein synthesis involves the delivery of aminoacyl-transfer RNAs to the aminoacyl-tRNA-binding site (A site) of the ribosome, followed by peptide-bond formation and translocation of the tRNAs through the ribosome to reopen the A site. The translocation reaction is catalysed by elongation factor G (EF-G) in a GTP-dependent manner. Despite the availability of structures of various EF-G-ribosome complexes, the precise mechanism by which tRNAs move through the ribosome still remains unclear. Here we use multiparticle cryoelectron microscopy analysis to resolve two previously unseen subpopulations within Thermus thermophilus EF-G-ribosome complexes at subnanometre resolution, one of them with a partly translocated tRNA. Comparison of these substates reveals that translocation of tRNA on the 30S subunit parallels the swivelling of the 30S head and is coupled to unratcheting of the 30S body. Because the tRNA maintains contact with the peptidyl-tRNA-binding site (P site) on the 30S head and simultaneously establishes interaction with the exit site (E site) on the 30S platform, a novel intra-subunit 'pe/E' hybrid state is formed. This state is stabilized by domain IV of EF-G, which interacts with the swivelled 30S-head conformation. These findings provide direct structural and mechanistic insight into the 'missing link' in terms of tRNA intermediates involved in the universally conserved translocation process.},

abstract = {Accurate computational prediction of protein structure represents a longstanding challenge in molecular biology and structure-based drug design. Although homology modeling techniques are widely used to produce low-resolution models, refining these models to high resolution has proven difficult. With long enough simulations and sufficiently accurate force fields, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations should in principle allow such refinement, but efforts to refine homology models using MD have for the most part yielded disappointing results. It has thus far been unclear whether MD-based refinement is limited primarily by accessible simulation timescales, force field accuracy, or both. Here, we examine MD as a technique for homology model refinement using all-atom simulations, each at least 100 $\mu$s long-more than 100 times longer than previous refinement simulations-and a physics-based force field that was recently shown to successfully fold a structurally diverse set of fast-folding proteins. In MD simulations of 24 proteins chosen from the refinement category of recent Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments, we find that in most cases, simulations initiated from homology models drift away from the native structure. Comparison with simulations initiated from the native structure suggests that force field accuracy is the primary factor limiting MD-based refinement. This problem can be mitigated to some extent by restricting sampling to the neighborhood of the initial model, leading to structural improvement that, while limited, is roughly comparable to the leading alternative methods.},

abstract = {Understanding protein-protein association is crucial in revealing the molecular basis of many biological processes. Here, we describe a theoretical simulation pipeline to study protein-protein association from an energy landscape perspective. First, a coarse-grained model is implemented and its applications are demonstrated via molecular dynamics simulations for several protein complexes. Second, an enhanced search method is used to efficiently sample a broad range of protein conformations. Third, multiple conformations are identified and clustered from simulation data and further projected on a three-dimensional globe specifying protein orientations and interacting energies. Results from several complexes indicate that the crystal-like conformation is favorable on the energy landscape even if the landscape is relatively rugged with metastable conformations. A closer examination on molecular forces shows that the formation of associated protein complexes can be primarily electrostatics-driven, hydrophobics-driven, or a combination of both in stabilizing specific binding interfaces. Taken together, these results suggest that the coarse-grained simulations and analyses provide an alternative toolset to study protein-protein association occurring in functional biomolecular complexes. ?? 2012 Biophysical Society.},

According to the August Forrester Report, 56 percent of IT managers interviewed at Global 2,500 companies are already using some type of open source software in their infrastructure and another 6 percent will install it in the next two years. This revolutionary model for collaborative software development is being embraced and studied by many of the biggest players in the high-tech industry, from Sun Microsystems to IBM to Intel.  The Cathedral \& the Bazaar is a must for anyone who cares about the future of the computer industry or the dynamics of the information economy. Already, billions of dollars have been made and lost based on the ideas in this book. Its conclusions will be studied, debated, and implemented for years to come. According to Bob Young, "This is Eric Raymond's great contribution to the success of the open source revolution, to the adoption of Linux-based operating systems, and to the success of open source users and the companies that supply them."  The interest in open source software development has grown enormously in the past year. This revised and expanded paperback edition includes new material on open source developments in 1999 and 2000. Raymond's clear and effective writing style accurately describing the benefits of open source software has been key to its success. With major vendors creating acceptance for open source within companies, independent vendors will become the open source story in 2001.},

abstract = {Formation of aberrant protein conformers is a common pathological denominator of different neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease or prion diseases. Moreover, increasing evidence indicates that soluble oligomers are associated with early pathological alterations and that oligomeric assemblies of different disease-associated proteins may share common structural features. Previous studies revealed that toxic effects of the scrapie prion protein (PrP(Sc)), a $\beta$-sheet-rich isoform of the cellular PrP (PrP(C)), are dependent on neuronal expression of PrP(C). In this study, we demonstrate that PrP(C) has a more general effect in mediating neurotoxic signalling by sensitizing cells to toxic effects of various $\beta$-sheet-rich ($\beta$) conformers of completely different origins, formed by (i) heterologous PrP, (ii) amyloid $\beta$-peptide, (iii) yeast prion proteins or (iv) designed $\beta$-peptides. Toxic signalling via PrP(C) requires the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (N-PrP) and the GPI anchor of PrP. We found that the N-terminal domain is important for mediating the interaction of PrP(C) with $\beta$-conformers. Interestingly, a secreted version of N-PrP associated with $\beta$-conformers and antagonized their toxic signalling via PrP(C). Moreover, PrP(C)-mediated toxic signalling could be blocked by an NMDA receptor antagonist or an oligomer-specific antibody. Our study indicates that PrP(C) can mediate toxic signalling of various $\beta$-sheet-rich conformers independent of infectious prion propagation, suggesting a pathophysiological role of the prion protein beyond of prion diseases.},

The APC35832 protein is a representative of large group of bacterial and archeal proteins entirely consisting of the Toprim (topoisomerase-primase) domain. This domain is found in the catalytic centers of many enzymes catalyzing phosphodiester bond formation or cleavage, but the function of small Toprim domain proteins remains unknown. Consistent with the sequence analysis, the APC35832 structure shows a conserved Toprim fold, with a central 4-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by four alpha-helixes. Comparison of the APC35832 structure with its closest structural homolog, the catalytic core of bacteriophage T7 primase, revealed structural conservation of a metal binding site and isothermal titration calorimetry indicates that APC35832 binds Mg2+ with a sub-millimolar dissociation constant (K(d)). The APC35832-Mg2+ complex structure was determined at 1.65 A and reveals the role of conserved acidic residues in Mg2+ ion coordination. The structural similarities to other Toprim domain containing proteins and potential function and substrates of APC35832 are discussed in this article.},

Here, we propose a method to obtain a reaction coordinate whose potential of the mean force can reproduce the commitment probability distribution from the multidimensional surface. We prove that such a relevant one-dimensional representation can be readily calculated from the equilibrium distribution of commitment probabilities, which can be obtained with simulations. Also, it is shown that this representation is complementary to a previously proposed one-dimensional representation based on a quadratic approximation of the potential energy surface. The usefulness of the method is examined with dynamics in a two-dimensional system, showing that the one-dimensional surface thus obtained can predict the existence of an intermediate and the occurrence of path switching without a priori knowledge of the morphology of the original surface. The applicability of the method to more complex and realistic reactions such as protein folding is also discussed.},

abstract = {Following the general procedure of Bernal \& Finney (1967) using Voronoi polyhedra, volumes occupied by all the atoms, or groups of atoms, in lysozyme and ribonuclease S have been estimated from the atomic co-ordinates provided by crystal structure studies. The average packing density for the interior of both proteins is close to 0.75, which is in the middle of the range found for crystals of most small organic molecules. For all atom types the mean packing densities fall between 0.7 and 0.8 with standard deviations between 0.1 and 0.2. It is suggested that simple geometrical packing considerations may provide useful criteria in guiding and evaluating trial structures in theoretical studies of protein folding, especially the association of distant parts of a peptide chain. Packing densities averaged over a relatively small number of atoms (5 to 15) appear to vary substantially in different parts of the same protein. Low densities representing packing defects may permit relatively easy motions, for example in an active site. Surrounding areas of high density may serve as relatively incompressible regions which transmit or correlate motions over considerable distances. The total volume of each of these two proteins as derived from the co-ordinate list appears to be larger than that estimated from the partial specific volume by 7 to 10\%. If this volume difference is attributed to a change in the packing of water in a monolayer surrounding the protein, it would correspond to an average decrease, relative to bulk water, of 1 to 2 \AA3 per water molecule in this monolayer. Such a change is about half of the decrease that occurs on the melting of ice.},

Kinetic analysis of mutations at 52 of the 57 residues in the src SH3 domain revealed that the transition state ensemble is even more polarized than suspected earlier: no single alanine substitution in the N-terminal 15 residues or the C-terminal 9 residues has more than a two-fold effect on the folding rate, while such substitutions at 15 sites in the central three-stranded beta-sheet cause significant decreases in the folding rate. Molecular dynamics (MD) unfolding simulations and ab initio folding simulations on the src SH3 domain exhibit a hierarchy of folding similar to that observed in the experiments. The similarity in folding mechanism of different SH3 domains and the similar hierarchy of structure formation observed in the experiments and the simulations can be largely accounted for by a simple native state topology-based model of protein folding energy landscapes.},

abstract = {The domains of the giant muscle protein titin (connectin) provide interaction sites for other sarcomeric proteins and fulfill mechanical functions. In this paper we compare the unfolding forces of defined regions of different titin isoforms by single-molecule force spectroscopy. Constructs comprising six to eight immunoglobulin (Ig) domains located in the mechanically active I-band part of titin are compared to those containing fibronectin III (Fn3) and Ig domains from the A-band part. The high spatial resolution of the atomic force microscope allows us to detect differences in length as low as a few amino acids. Thus constructs of different lengths may be used as molecular rulers for structural comparisons with other modular proteins. The unfolding forces range between 150 and 300 pN and differ systematically between the constructs. Fn3 domains in titin exhibit 20\% lower unfolding forces than Ig domains. Fn3 domains from tenascin, however, unfold at forces only half those of titin Fn3 domains. This indicates that the tightly folded titin domains are designed to maintain their structural integrity, even under the influence of stretching forces. Hence, at physiological forces, unfolding is unlikely unless the forces are applied for a long time (longer than minutes).},

abstract = {So-called coarse-grained models are a popular type of model for accessing long time scales in simulations of biomolecular processes. Such models are coarse-grained with respect to atomic models. But any modelling of processes or substances involves coarse-graining, i.e. the elimination of non-essential degrees of freedom and interactions from a more fine-grained level of modelling. The basic ingredients of developing coarse-grained models based on the properties of fine-grained models are reviewed, together with the conditions that must be satisfied in order to preserve the correct physical mechanisms in the coarse-graining process. This overview should help the reader to determine how realistic a coarse-grained model of a biomolecular system is, i.e. whether it reflects the underlying physical mechanisms or merely provides a set of pretty pictures of the process or substances of interest.},

abstract = {In this work, the extension of the previously developed domain based local pair-natural orbital (DLPNO) based singles- and doubles coupled cluster (DLPNO-CCSD) method to perturbatively include connected triple excitations is reported. The development is based on the concept of triples-natural orbitals that span the joint space of the three pair natural orbital (PNO) spaces of the three electron pairs that are involved in the calculation of a given triple-excitation contribution. The truncation error is very smooth and can be significantly reduced through extrapolation to the zero threshold. However, the extrapolation procedure does not improve relative energies. The overall computational effort of the method is asymptotically linear with the system size O(N). Actual linear scaling has been confirmed in test calculations on alkane chains. The accuracy of the DLPNO-CCSD(T) approximation relative to semicanonical CCSD(T0) is comparable to the previously developed DLPNO-CCSD method relative to canonical CCSD. Relative energies are predicted with an average error of approximately 0.5 kcal∕mol for a challenging test set of medium sized organic molecules. The triples correction typically adds 30\%-50\% to the overall computation time. Thus, very large systems can be treated on the basis of the current implementation. In addition to the linear C150H302 (452 atoms, >8800 basis functions) we demonstrate the first CCSD(T) level calculation on an entire protein, Crambin with 644 atoms, and more than 6400 basis functions.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: It has been recently suggested that atomic burials, as expressed by molecular central distances, contain sufficient information to determine the tertiary structure of small globular proteins. A possible approach to structural determination from sequence could therefore involve a sequence-to-burial intermediate prediction step whose accuracy, however, is theoretically limited by the mutual information between these two variables. We use a non-redundant set of globular protein structures to estimate the mutual information between local amino acid sequence and atomic burials. Discretizing central distances of or atoms in equiprobable burial levels, we estimate relevant mutual information measures that are compared with actual predictions obtained from a Naive Bayesian Classifier (NBC) and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

RESULTS: Mutual information density for 20 amino acids and two or three burial levels were estimated to be roughly 15\% of the unconditional burial entropy density. Lower estimates for the mutual information between local amino acid sequence and burial of a single residue indicated an increase in mutual information with the number of burial levels up to at least five or six levels. Prediction schemes were found to efficiently extract the available burial information from local sequence. Lower estimates for the mutual information involving single burials are consistently approached by predictions from the NBC and actually surpassed by predictions from the HMM. Near-optimal prediction for the HMM is indicated by the agreement between its density of prediction information and the corresponding density of mutual information between input and output representations.

AVAILABILITY: The dataset of protein structures and the prediction implementations are available at http://www.btc.unb.br/ (in 'Software').},

abstract = {It has been known for nearly 100 years that pressure unfolds proteins, yet the physical basis of this effect is not understood. Unfolding by pressure implies that the molar volume of the unfolded state of a protein is smaller than that of the folded state. This decrease in volume has been proposed to arise from differences between the density of bulk water and water associated with the protein, from pressure-dependent changes in the structure of bulk water, from the loss of internal cavities in the folded states of proteins, or from some combination of these three factors. Here, using 10 cavity-containing variants of staphylococcal nuclease, we demonstrate that pressure unfolds proteins primarily as a result of cavities that are present in the folded state and absent in the unfolded one. High-pressure NMR spectroscopy and simulations constrained by the NMR data were used to describe structural and energetic details of the folding landscape of staphylococcal nuclease that are usually inaccessible with existing experimental approaches using harsher denaturants. Besides solving a 100-year-old conundrum concerning the detailed structural origins of pressure unfolding of proteins, these studies illustrate the promise of pressure perturbation as a unique tool for examining the roles of packing, conformational fluctuations, and water penetration as determinants of solution properties of proteins, and for detecting folding intermediates and other structural details of protein-folding landscapes that are invisible to standard experimental approaches.},

abstract = {The folding of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) is known to proceed via a major intermediate in which the central OB subdomain is folded and the C-terminal helical subdomain is disordered. To identify the structural and energetic determinants of this folding free energy landscape, we have examined in detail, using high-pressure NMR, the consequences of cavity creating mutations in each of the two subdomains of an ultrastable SNase, $\Delta$+PHS. The stabilizing mutations of $\Delta$+PHS enhanced the population of the major folding intermediate. Cavity creation in two different regions of the $\Delta$+PHS reference protein, despite equivalent effects on global stability, had very distinct consequences on the complexity of the folding free energy landscape. The L125A substitution in the C-terminal helix of $\Delta$+PHS slightly suppressed the major intermediate and promoted an additional excited state involving disorder in the N-terminus, but otherwise decreased landscape heterogeneity with respect to the $\Delta$+PHS background protein. The I92A substitution, located in the hydrophobic OB-fold core, had a much more profound effect, resulting in a significant increase in the number of intermediate states and implicating the entire protein structure. Denaturant (GuHCl) had very subtle and specific effects on the landscape, suppressing some states and favoring others, depending upon the mutational context. These results demonstrate that disrupting interactions in a region of the protein with highly cooperative, unfrustrated folding has very profound effects on the roughness of the folding landscape, whereas the effects are less pronounced for an energetically equivalent substitution in an already frustrated region.},

abstract = {The time required to fold proteins usually increases significantly under conditions of high pressure. Taking advantage of this general property of proteins, we combined P-jump experiments with NMR spectroscopy to examine in detail the folding reaction of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) and of some of its cavity-containing variants. The nearly 100 observables that could be measured simultaneously collectively describe the kinetics of folding as a function of pressure and denaturant concentration with exquisite site-specific resolution. SNase variants with cavities in the central core of the protein exhibit a highly heterogeneous transition-state ensemble (TSE) with a smaller solvent-excluded void volume than the TSE of the parent SNase. This heterogeneous TSE experiences Hammond behavior, becoming more native-like (higher molar volume) with increasing denaturant concentration. In contrast, the TSE of the L125A variant, which has a cavity at the secondary core, is only slightly different from that of the parent SNase. Because pressure acts mainly to eliminate solvent-excluded voids, which are heterogeneously distributed throughout structures, it perturbs the protein more selectively than chemical denaturants, thereby facilitating the characterization of intermediates and the consequences of packing on folding mechanisms. Besides demonstrating how internal cavities can affect the routes and rates of folding of a protein, this study illustrates how the combination of P-jump and NMR spectroscopy can yield detailed mechanistic insight into protein folding reactions with exquisite site-specific temporal information.},

abstract = {Under physiological conditions, a protein undergoes a spontaneous disorder order transition called "folding." The protein polymer is highly flexible when unfolded but adopts its unique native, three-dimensional structure when folded. Current experimental knowledge comes primarily from thermodynamic measurements in solution or the structures of individual molecules, elucidated by either x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. From the former, we know the enthalpy, entropy, and free energy differences between the folded and unfolded forms of hundreds of proteins under a variety of solvent/cosolvent conditions. From the latter, we know the structures of approximately 35,000 proteins, which are built on scaffolds of hydrogen-bonded structural elements, alpha-helix and beta-sheet. Anfinsen showed that the amino acid sequence alone is sufficient to determine a protein's structure, but the molecular mechanism responsible for self-assembly remains an open question, probably the most fundamental open question in biochemistry. This perspective is a hybrid: partly review, partly proposal. First, we summarize key ideas regarding protein folding developed over the past half-century and culminating in the current mindset. In this view, the energetics of side-chain interactions dominate the folding process, driving the chain to self-organize under folding conditions. Next, having taken stock, we propose an alternative model that inverts the prevailing side-chain/backbone paradigm. Here, the energetics of backbone hydrogen bonds dominate the folding process, with preorganization in the unfolded state. Then, under folding conditions, the resultant fold is selected from a limited repertoire of structural possibilities, each corresponding to a distinct hydrogen-bonded arrangement of alpha-helices and/or strands of beta-sheet.},

abstract = {Tau is an intrinsically unstructured microtubule (MT)-associated protein capable of binding to and organizing MTs into evenly spaced parallel assemblies known as “MT bundles.” How tau achieves MT bundling is enigmatic because each tau molecule possesses only one MT-binding region. To dissect this complex behavior, we have used a surface forces apparatus to measure the interaction forces of the six CNS tau isoforms when bound to mica substrates in vitro. Two types of measurements were performed for each isoform: symmetric configuration experiments measured the interactions between two tau-coated mica surfaces, whereas “asymmetric” experiments examined tau-coated surfaces interacting with a smooth bare mica surface. Depending on the configuration (of which there were 12), the forces were weakly adhesive, strongly adhesive, or purely repulsive. The equilibrium spacing was determined mainly by the length of the tau projection domain, in contrast to the adhesion force/energy, which was determined by the number of repeats in the MT-binding region. Taken together, the data are incompatible with tau acting as a monomer; rather, they indicate that two tau molecules associate in an antiparallel configuration held together by an electrostatic “zipper” of complementary salt bridges composed of the N-terminal and central regions of each tau monomer, with the C-terminal MT-binding regions extending outward from each end of the dimeric backbone.

abstract = {Secondary chemical shift analysis has been used to characterize the unfolded state of acid-denatured c-src SH3. Even though native c-src SH3 adopts an all-beta fold, we found evidence of transient helicity in regions corresponding to native loops. In particular, residues 40-46, connecting the n-src loop to the third beta-strand, exhibited an apparent helicity of nearly 45\%. Furthermore, the RT loop and the diverging turn appeared to adopt non-native-like helical conformations. Interestingly, none of the residues found in transient helical conformations exhibited significant varphi-values [Riddle, D. S., et al. (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6, 1016-1024]. This indicated that the transient helicity has no influence or only a weak influence on the actual protein folding reaction. The residual structural propensities were compared to those of other SH3 domains, revealing heterogeneity in the unfolded ensemble that clearly contrasts with the conserved character of the topology of native state and transition state ensembles typical for SH3 domains.},

abstract = {The application of hydrostatic pressure generally leads to protein unfolding, implying, in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle, that the unfolded state has a smaller molar volume than the folded state. However, the origin of the volume change upon unfolding, $\Delta$V(u), has yet to be determined. We have examined systematically the effects of protein size and sequence on the value of $\Delta$V(u) using as a model system a series of deletion variants of the ankyrin repeat domain of the Notch receptor. The results provide strong evidence in support of the notion that the major contributing factor to pressure effects on proteins is their imperfect internal packing in the folded state. These packing defects appear to be specifically localized in the 3D structure, in contrast to the uniformly distributed effects of temperature and denaturants that depend upon hydration of exposed surface area upon unfolding. Given its local nature, the extent to which pressure globally affects protein structure can inform on the degree of cooperativity and long-range coupling intrinsic to the folded state. We also show that the energetics of the protein's conformations can significantly modulate their volumetric properties, providing further insight into protein stability.},

abstract = {An issue of general interest in computer simulations is to incorporate information from experiments into a structural model. An important caveat in pursuing this goal is to avoid corrupting the resulting model with spurious and arbitrary biases. While the problem of biasing thermodynamic ensembles can be formulated rigorously using the maximum entropy method introduced by Jaynes, the approach can be cumbersome in practical applications with the need to determine multiple unknown coefficients iteratively. A popular alternative strategy to incorporate the information from experiments is to rely on restrained-ensemble molecular dynamics simulations. However, the fundamental validity of this computational strategy remains in question. Here, it is demonstrated that the statistical distribution produced by restrained-ensemble simulations is formally consistent with the maximum entropy method of Jaynes. This clarifies the underlying conditions under which restrained-ensemble simulations will yield results that are consistent with the maximum entropy method.},

@article{Roy2005,
abstract = {A minimalist Go-model, with no energetic frustration in the native conformation, has been shown to describe accurately the folding pathway of the beta-trefoil protein, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). While it appears that these models successfully model transition states and intermediates between the unfolded and native ensembles, it is unclear how accurately they capture smaller, yet biologically relevant, structural changes within the native ensemble after energetic perturbation. Here, we address the following questions. Can a simple Go-model of interleukin-1beta, based on native topology, describe changes in structural properties of the native ensemble as the protein stability is changed? Or is it necessary to include a more explicit representation of atoms, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces to describe these changes? The native ensemble of IL-1beta was characterized using a variety of experimental probes under native (0 M NaCl, guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl)), moderately destabilized (0 M NaCl, 0.8 M Gdn-HCl), and in moderate salt concentration (0.8 M NaCl, 0 M Gdn-HCl). Heteronuclear (1)H-(15)N nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) and heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) NMR spectra confirmed that the beta-trefoil global fold was largely intact under these three conditions. However, 25 of the 153 residues throughout the chain did demonstrate (13)C and (1)H-(15)N chemical shifts when perturbed with 0.8 M NaCl or Gdn-HCl. Despite large differences in protection factors from solvent hydrogen-deuterium exchange for all residues between stable (0 M Gdn-HCl) and destabilized (0.8 M Gdn-HCl) IL-1beta, no difference in steady-state (15)N-(1)H NOE enhancements were measured. Thus, the chemical shifts correlate with a global but limited increase in residue flexibility in the presence of Gdn-HCl. Minimalist simulations highlight the regions of greatest position shift between native and 0.8 M Gdn-HCl, which were determined experimentally. This correlation demonstrates that structural changes within the native ensemble of IL-1beta are, at least partially, governed by the principle of minimal energetic frustration.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) models enable highly efficient simulations of complex processes that cannot be effectively studied with more detailed models. CG models are often parameterized using either force- or structure-motivated approaches. The present work investigates parallels between these seemingly divergent approaches by examining the relative entropy and multiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) methods. We demonstrate that both approaches can be expressed in terms of an information function that discriminates between the ensembles generated by atomistic and CG models. While it is well known that the relative entropy approach minimizes the average of this information function, the present work demonstrates that the MS-CG method minimizes the average of its gradient squared. We generalize previous results by establishing conditions for the uniqueness of structure-based potentials and identify similarities with corresponding conditions for the uniqueness of MS-CG potentials. We analyze the mapping entropy and extend the MS-CG and generalized-Yvon-Born-Green formalisms for more complex potentials. Finally, we present numerical calculations that highlight similarities and differences between structure- and force-based approaches. We demonstrate that both methods obtain identical results, not only for a complete basis set, but also for an incomplete harmonic basis set in Cartesian coordinates. However, the two methods differ when the incomplete basis set includes higher order polynomials of Cartesian coordinates or is expressed as functions of curvilinear coordinates.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) models often employ pair potentials that are parametrized to reproduce radial distribution functions (rdf's) determined for an atomistic model. This implies that the CG model must reproduce the corresponding atomistic mean forces. These mean forces include not only a direct contribution from the corresponding interaction but also correlated contributions from the surrounding environment. The many-body correlations that influence this second contribution present significant challenges for accurately reproducing atomistic distribution functions. This work presents a detailed investigation of these many-body correlations and their significance for determining CG potentials while using liquid heptane as a model system. We employ a transparent geometric framework for directly determining CG potentials that has been previously developed within the context of the multiscale coarse-graining and generalized Yvon-Born-Green methods. In this framework, a metric tensor quantifies the relevant many-body correlations and precisely decomposes atomistic mean forces into contributions from specific interactions, which then determine the CG force field. Numerical investigations reveal that this metric tensor reflects both the CG representation and also subtle correlations between molecular geometry and intermolecular packing, but can be largely interpreted in terms of generic considerations. Our calculations demonstrate that contributions from correlated interactions can significantly impact the pair mean force and, thus, also the CG force field. Finally, an eigenvector analysis investigates the importance of these interactions for reproducing atomistic distribution functions.},

abstract = {Protein folding is an inherently complex process involving coordination of the intricate networks of weak interactions that stabilize native three-dimensional structures. In the conventional paradigm, simple protein structures are assumed to fold in an all-or-none process that is inaccessible to experiment. Existing experimental methods therefore probe folding mechanisms indirectly. A widely used approach interprets changes in protein stability and/or folding kinetics, induced by engineered mutations, in terms of the structure of the native protein. In addition to limitations in connecting energetics with structure, mutational methods have significant experimental uncertainties and are unable to map complex networks of interactions. In contrast, analytical theory predicts small barriers to folding and the possibility of downhill folding. These theoretical predictions have been confirmed experimentally in recent years, including the observation of global downhill folding. However, a key remaining question is whether downhill folding can indeed lead to the high-resolution analysis of protein folding processes. Here we show, with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), that the downhill protein BBL from Escherichia coli unfolds atom by atom starting from a defined three-dimensional structure. Thermal unfolding data on 158 backbone and side-chain protons out of a total of 204 provide a detailed view of the structural events during folding. This view confirms the statistical nature of folding, and exposes the interplay between hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic forces, backbone conformation and side-chain entropy. From the data we also obtain a map of the interaction network in this protein, which reveals the source of folding cooperativity. Our approach can be extended to other proteins with marginal barriers (less than 3RT), providing a new tool for the study of protein folding.},

abstract = {Protein stability is not just an academic matter. Biotechnology, Cell Biology and Drug Design are some of the fields where both theoretical and practical knowledge of protein stability is required. Simple equipment and chemicals, such as a thermostated fluorimeter and common denaturants, suffice to determine the conformational stability of a protein. To this end, the most important experiments are the preliminary ones done to establish the minimum number of species (conformations) accumulating in the equilibrium. For proteins with non-functional equilibrium intermediates, determining the relevant stability of the protein (the free energy difference between the native conformation and the intermediate) is most important, and it allows very valuable structural information on the intermediate to be derived when protein variants are compared to wild type using equilibrium ϕ-analysis. The principles, tricks and equations involved in the analysis of denaturant induced or temperature induced equilibrium unfolding curves by the linear extrapolation method or using the integrated Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, respectively, will be discussed, and a brief outline of challenges and frontiers in the protein stability field will be presented.},

Successful attempts in fabricating the protein-based bioelectronics could serve as a promising alternative to synthetic template based nanomaterials. Another perspective of protein assemblies is its use in the field of tissue engineering either as scaffold for cell adhesion and proliferation or as a foreign (bio)nanofunctionality to communicate with the macromolecules present in the extracellular or intracellular milieu and participate in the precise control of vital cell functions. Three-dimensionally arranged protein monomers to form bionanotubes are promising in terms of innate biocompatibility, easy bio-conjugation to incorporate multiple functionalities and well-defined nano-scale lengths.

The dynamics of a single gene switch resembles the spin-boson model of a two-site polaron or an electron transfer reaction. Networks of switches can be approximately described as quantum spin systems by using an appropriate variational principle. In this way, the concept of frustration for magnetic systems can be taken over into gene networks. The landscape of stable attractors depends on the degree and style of frustration, much as for neural networks. We show the number of attractors, which may represent cell types, is much smaller for appropriately designed weakly frustrated stochastic networks than for randomly connected networks.},

abstract = {Most materials attain a glassy state at low temperatures under suitable methods of preparation. This state exhibits the mechanical properties of a solid, but shows microscopic structural disorder1,2. A comprehensive understanding of the glassy state is, however, still lacking3. A widespread assumption is that the non-exponential relaxation processes observed in the dynamics of glasses — and also in protein dynamics, protein folding and population dynamics — are (in common with other manifestations of complex dynamics) strongly influenced by the underlying energy landscape associated with the structural configurations that the system may adopt. But concrete evidence for this in studies of glass formation has been scarce. Here we present such evidence, obtained from computer simulations of a model glass-forming liquid. We demonstrate that the onset of non-exponential relaxation corresponds to a well defined temperature below which the depth of the potential-energy minima explored by the liquid increases with decreasing temperature, and above which it does not. At lower temperatures, we observe a sharp transition when the liquid gets trapped in the deepest accessible energy basin. This transition temperature depends on the cooling rate, in a manner analogous to the experimental glass transition. We also present evidence that the barrier heights separating potential-energy minima sampled by the liquid increase abruptly at a temperature above the glass transition but well below the onset of non-exponential relaxation. This identification of a relationship between static, topographic features of the energy landscape and complex dynamics holds the promise of a clearer, possibly thermodynamic, understanding of the glass transition.

abstract = {The B domain of protein A (BdpA) is a popular paradigm for simulating protein folding pathways. The discrepancies between so many simulations and subsequent experimental testing may be attributable to the protein being highly symmetrical: changing experimental conditions could perturb the subtle interplay between the effects of symmetry in the native structure and the effects of asymmetry from specific interactions in a given sequence. If the protein folds via multiple pathways, perturbations, such as temperature, denaturant concentration, and mutation, should change the flux of micro pathways, leading to changes in the bulk properties of the transition state. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a Phi-analysis of BdpA as a function of temperature from 25.0 degrees C to 60.0 degrees C. The Phi-values had no significant dependence on temperature and the values at 55.0 degrees C (denaturing conditions) are very similar to those at 25.0 degrees C (folding conditions), indicating the structure of the transition state does not significantly change although the experimental conditions are considerably altered. The results suggest that BdpA folds via a single dominant folding pathway.},

abstract = {We have assessed the published predictions of the pathway of folding of the B domain of protein A, the pathway most studied by computer simulation. We analyzed the transition state for folding of the three-helix bundle protein, by using experimental Phi values on some 70 suitable mutants. Surprisingly, the third helix, which has the most stable alpha-helical structure as a peptide fragment, is poorly formed in the transition state, especially at its C terminus. The protein folds around a nearly fully formed central helix, which is stabilized by extensive hydrophobic side chain interactions. The turn connecting the poorly structured first helix to the central helix is unstructured, but the turn connecting the central helix to the third is in the process of being formed as the N-terminal region of the third helix begins to coalesce. The transition state is inconsistent with a classical framework mechanism and is closer to nucleation-condensation. None of the published atomistic simulations are fully consistent with the experimental picture although many capture important features. There is a continuing need for combining simulation with experiment to describe folding pathways, and of continued testing to improve predictive methods.},

abstract = {We examined the co-operativity of ultra-fast folding of a protein and whether the Phi-value analysis of its transition state depended on the location of the optical probe. We incorporated in turn a tryptophan residue into each of the three helices of the B domain of Protein A. Each Trp mutant of the three-helix bundle protein was used as a pseudo-wild-type parent for Phi-analysis in which the intrinsic Trp fluorescence probed the formation of each helix during the transition state. Apart from local effects in the immediate vicinity of the probe, the three separate sets of Phi-values were in excellent agreement, demonstrating the overall co-operativity of folding and the robustness of the Phi-analysis. The transition state of folding of Protein A contains the second helix being well formed with many stabilizing tertiary hydrophobic interactions. In contrast, the first and the third helices are more poorly structured in the transition state. The mechanism of folding thus involves the concurrent formation of secondary and tertiary interactions, and is towards the nucleation-condensation extreme in the nucleation-condensation-framework continuum of mechanism, with helix 2 being the nucleus. We provide an error analysis of Phi-values derived purely from the kinetics of two-state chevron plots.},

Anomalous diffraction data were used to place bound anions and cations. This reveals ordered water molecules at the level of two rings of hydroxylated residues (named Ser6' and Thr2') that contribute to the ion selectivity filter. Two water pentagons are observed, a self-stabilized ice-like water pentagon and a second wider water pentagon, with one sodium ion between them. Single-channel electrophysiology shows that the side-chain hydroxyl of Ser6' is crucial for ion translocation. Simulations and electrostatics calculations complemented the description of hydration in the pore and suggest that the water pentagons observed in the crystal are important for the ion to cross hydrophobic constriction barriers. Simulations that pull a cation through the pore reveal that residue Ser6' actively contributes to ion translocation by reorienting its side chain when the ion is going through the pore. Generalization of these findings to the pLGIC family is proposed.},

We compare three of these models, using coarse-grained analysis of molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the differences between them and evaluate their relative stability. Based on this analysis, we identify key motions that may be associated with polymerization, including a potential energetic barrier in the process.

We discuss here the theoretical underpinnings and history of coarse-graining and summarize the state of the field, organizing key methodologies based on an emerging paradigm for multiscale theory and modeling of biomolecular systems. This framework involves an integrated, iterative approach to couple information from different scales. The primary steps, which coincide with key areas of method development, include developing first-pass coarse-grained models guided by experimental results, performing numerous large-scale coarse-grained simulations, identifying important interactions that drive emergent behaviors, and finally reconnecting to the molecular scale by performing all-atom molecular dynamics simulations guided by the coarse-grained results. The coarse-grained modeling can then be extended and refined, with the entire loop repeated iteratively if necessary.},

These methods are grouped into two broad categories-mapping methods, which use information from one scale of representation to parameterize a lower resolution model, and bridging methods, which repeatedly connect different scales during simulation-and we provide examples of both classes at different levels of complexity. Collectively, these models illustrate the numerous approaches to information transfer between scales and demonstrate that the complexity required of the model depends in general on the nature of the information sought.},

abstract = {Coarse-graining of atomistic force fields allows us to investigate complex biological problems, occurring at long timescales and large length scales. In this work, we have developed an accurate coarse-grained model for double-stranded DNA chain, derived systematically from atomistic simulations. Our approach is based on matching correlators obtained from atomistic and coarse-grained simulations, for observables that explicitly enter the coarse-grained Hamiltonian. We show that this requirement leads to equivalency of the corresponding partition functions, resulting in a one-step renormalization. Compared to prior works exploiting similar ideas, the main novelty of this work is the introduction of a highly compact set of Hamiltonian basis functions, based on molecular interaction potentials. We demonstrate that such compactification allows us to reproduce many-body effects, generated by one-step renormalization, at low computational cost. In addition, compact Hamiltonians greatly increase the likelihood of finding unique solutions for the coarse-grained force-field parameter values. By successfully applying our molecular renormalization group coarse-graining technique to double-stranded DNA, we solved, for the first time, a long-standing problem in coarse-graining polymer systems, namely, how to accurately capture the correlations among various polymeric degrees of freedom. Excellent agreement is found among atomistic and coarse-grained distribution functions for various structural observables, including those not included in the Hamiltonian. We also suggest higher-order generalization of this method, which may allow capturing more subtle correlations in biopolymer dynamics.},

abstract = {Simplified, yet accurate, coarse-grained models are needed to explore the behavior of complex biological systems by means of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, because many interesting processes occur at long time scales and large length scales that are not amenable to studies by atomistic simulations. The aqueous salt buffer provides an important contribution to the structure and function of biological molecules. While in many simplified models both water and salt are treated as a continuous medium, it is often desirable to describe mobile ions in an explicit manner. For example, the discrete nature of ions was shown to play a very important role in their interaction with highly charged biomolecules, such as DNA. In this work, we have derived an effective interaction potential for monovalent ions by systematically coarse-graining the all-atom NaCl and KCl aqueous solutions at several different ionic concentrations. Our approach is based on explicitly accounting for cross-correlations among various observables that constitute the compact basis set of the coarse-grained Hamiltonian. Compactness of the Hamiltonian ensures computational efficiency of the optimization procedure. In addition, it allows us to accurately reproduce many-body effects, in contrast with many existing algorithms. The resulting Hamiltonian produced ionic distributions that are virtually identical to those obtained in atomistic simulations with explicit water, capturing short-range hydration effects. Our coarse-grained model of monovalent electrolyte solutions allows the incorporation of ions into complex coarse-grained biomolecular simulations, where both electrostatic and short-range hydration effects must be taken into account.},

The theory provides a synthesis of classical models of the helix-coil transition in polymers with an approximate treatment of the effects of excluded volume, confinement, and packing alignment of the helices based on a free energy function. The theory studies the consequences of signals encoded locally in the sequence as stabilization energies associated with three types of local structure: native helical conformations, native non-helical conformations, and native helix caps or start-stop signals. The role of randomness in the energies of conformations due to tertiary interactions is also studied vis-\`{a}-vis the difficulty of conformational search. The thermal behavior of the model is presented for realistic values of the conformational signal energies, which can be estimated from experimental studies on peptide fragments. Estimates are made for the relative contribution of local signals and specific tertiary interactions to the folding stability gap.},

abstract = {To determine the extent to which protein folding rates and free energy landscapes have been shaped by natural selection, we have examined the folding kinetics of five proteins generated using computational design methods and, hence, never exposed to natural selection. Four of these proteins are complete computer-generated redesigns of naturally occurring structures and the fifth protein, called Top7, has a computer-generated fold not yet observed in nature. We find that three of the four redesigned proteins fold much faster than their naturally occurring counterparts. While natural selection thus does not appear to operate on protein folding rates, the majority of the designed proteins unfold considerably faster than their naturally occurring counterparts, suggesting possible selection for a high free energy barrier to unfolding. In contrast to almost all naturally occurring proteins of less than 100 residues but consistent with simple computational models, the folding energy landscape for Top7 appears to be quite complex, suggesting the smooth energy landscapes and highly cooperative folding transitions observed for small naturally occurring proteins may also reflect the workings of natural selection.},

abstract = {A general method for facilitating the interpretation of computer simulations of protein folding with minimally frustrated energy landscapes is detailed and applied to a designed ankyrin repeat protein (4ANK). In the method, groups of residues are assigned to foldons and these foldons are used to map the conformational space of the protein onto a set of discrete macrobasins. The free energies of the individual macrobasins are then calculated, informing practical kinetic analysis. Two simple assumptions about the universality of the rate for downhill transitions between macrobasins and the natural local connectivity between macrobasins lead to a scheme for predicting overall folding and unfolding rates, generating chevron plots under varying thermodynamic conditions, and inferring dominant kinetic folding pathways. To illustrate the approach, free energies of macrobasins were calculated from biased simulations of a non-additive structure-based model using two structurally motivated foldon definitions at the full and half ankyrin repeat resolutions. The calculated chevrons have features consistent with those measured in stopped flow chemical denaturation experiments. The dominant inferred folding pathway has an "inside-out", nucleation-propagation like character.},

We discuss in detail microscopic aspects of the various contributions to the free energy gap of proteins and put emphasis on how a cosolvent may either enlarge or diminish this gap. We review briefly the various experimental approaches to measure changes in protein stability induced by cosolvents, denaturants, but also by pressure and temperature.

abstract = {Glutamate receptor ion channels are membrane proteins that mediate excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system of vertebrates. Insight into molecular mechanisms underlying glutamate receptor gating is limited by lack of structural information for receptors trapped in different conformational states. Here, we report the use of single-particle cryoelectron tomography to determine the structures, at ∼21 \AA resolution, of full-length GluK2 kainate receptors trapped in antagonist-bound resting and agonist-bound desensitized states. The resting state, stabilized by the competitive antagonist LY466195, closely resembles the crystal structure of the AMPA receptor GluA2, with well-resolved proximal and distal subunits exhibiting cross-over between the twofold symmetric amino terminal domain and a twofold symmetric ligand binding domain (LBD) dimer of dimers assembly. In the desensitized state, the LBD undergoes a major rearrangement, resulting in a separation of the four subunits by ∼25 \AA. However, the amino terminal domain, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions of the receptor have similar conformations in the resting and desensitized states. The LBD rearrangement was not anticipated in prior models based on crystal structures for soluble LBD dimer assemblies, and we speculate that subunit separation allows a better match to the fourfold symmetric ion channel domain. From fits of the amino terminal domain and LBD domains into the density map of the desensitized state we have derived a structural model for differences in quaternary conformation between the resting and desensitized states.},

abstract = {Extracellular signals prompt G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to adopt an active conformation (R*) and catalyze GDP/GTP exchange in the alpha-subunit of intracellular G proteins (Galphabetagamma). Kinetic analysis of transducin (G(t)alphabetagamma) activation shows that an intermediary R*xG(t)alphabetagamma.GDP complex is formed that precedes GDP release and formation of the nucleotide-free R*xG protein complex. Based on this reaction sequence, we explore the dynamic interface between the proteins during formation of these complexes. We start from the R* conformation stabilized by a G(t)alpha C-terminal peptide (GalphaCT) obtained from crystal structures of the GPCR opsin. Molecular modeling allows reconstruction of the fully elongated C-terminal alpha-helix of G(t)alpha (alpha5) and shows how alpha5 can be docked to the open binding site of R*. Two modes of interaction are found. One of them--termed stable or S-interaction--matches the position of the GalphaCT peptide in the crystal structure and reproduces the hydrogen-bonding networks between the C-terminal reverse turn of GalphaCT and conserved E(D)RY and NPxxY(x)(5,6)F regions of the GPCR. The alternative fit--termed intermediary or I-interaction--is distinguished by a tilt (42 degrees ) and rotation (90 degrees ) of alpha5 relative to the S-interaction and shows different alpha5 contacts with the NPxxY(x)(5,6)F region and the second cytoplasmic loop of R*. From the 2 alpha5 interactions, we derive a "helix switch" mechanism for the transition of R*xG(t)alphabetagamma.GDP to the nucleotide-free R*xG protein complex that illustrates how alpha5 might act as a transmission rod to propagate the conformational change from the receptor-G protein interface to the nucleotide binding site.},

abstract = {A general peptide design is presented that links the pH-dependent intramolecular folding of beta-hairpin peptides to their propensity to self-assemble, affording hydrogels rich in beta-sheet. Chemical responsiveness has been specifically engineered into the material by linking intramolecular folding to changes in solution pH, and mechanical responsiveness, by linking hydrogelation to self-assembly. Circular dichroic and infrared spectroscopies show that at low pH individual peptides are unstructured, affording a low-viscosity aqueous solution. Under basic conditions, intramolecular folding takes place, affording amphiphilic beta-hairpins that intermolecularly self-assemble. Rheology shows that the resulting hydrogel is rigid but is shear-thinning. However, quick mechanical strength recovery after cessation of shear is observed due to the inherent self-assembled nature of the scaffold. Characterization of the gelation process, from the molecular level up through the macroscopic properties of the material, suggests that by linking the intramolecular folding of small designed peptides to their ability to self-assemble, responsive materials can be prepared. Cryo-transmission electron and laser scanning confocal microscopies reveal a water-filled porous scaffold on both the nano- and microscale. The environmental responsiveness, morphology, and peptidic nature make this hydrogel a possible material candidate for biomedical and engineering technology.},

abstract = {The interaction of barnase, an extracellular RNase of Bacillus amylolique-faciens, with its intracellular inhibitor barstar is a suitable paradigm for protein-protein interactions, since the structures of both the free and the complexed proteins are available at high resolution. The contributions of residues from both proteins to the energetics of kinetics and thermodynamics of binding were measured by double mutant cycle analysis. Such cycles reveal whether the contributions from a pair of residues are additive, or the effects of mutations are coupled. The aim of the study was to determine which of the interactions are co-operative. Double mutant cycles were constructed between a subset of five barnase and seven barstar residues, which were shown by structural and mutagenesis studies to be important in stabilising the complex. The coupling energy between two residues was found to decrease with the distance between them. Generally, residues separated by less than 7 A interact co-operatively. At greater separations, the effects of mutation are additive, and the energetics of the interactions are independent of each other. The highest coupling energies are found between pairs of charged residues (1.6 to 7 kcal mol-1). Three of the six most important interactions detected by double mutant cycle analysis (with coupling energies of more than 3.0 kcal mol-1) had not been noted previously from examination of the crystal structure. The effects of mutation on the kinetics of association are all additive, apart from charged residues located at distances of up to 10 A apart, which are co-operative. This can be explained by the fact that the transition state for association occurs before most interactions are formed.},

abstract = {Conformational transitions play a central role in regulating protein function. Structure-based models with multiple basins have been used to understand the mechanisms governing these transitions. A model able to accommodate multiple folding basins is proposed to explore the mutational effects in the folding of the Rop-dimer (Rop). In experiments, Rop mutants show unusually strong increases in folding rates with marginal effects on stability. We investigate the possibility of two competing conformations representing a parallel (P) and the wild-type antiparallel (AP) arrangement of the monomers as possible native conformations. We observe occupation of both distinct states and characterize the transition pathways. An interesting observation from the simulations is that, for equivalent energetic bias, the transition to the P basin (non-wild-type basin) shows a lower free-energy barrier. Thus, the rapid kinetics observed in experiments appear to be the result of two competing states with different kinetic behavior, triggered upon mutation by the opening of a trapdoor arising from Rop's symmetric structure. The general concept of having competing conformations for the native state goes beyond explaining Rop's mutational behaviors and can be applied to other systems. A switch between competing native structures might be triggered by external factors to allow, for example, allosteric control or signaling.},

Deterministic models and the diffusion approximation to the master equation break down at the limits of protein populations in a way very analogous to the breakdown of geometrical optics that occurs at distances <1 wavelength of light from edges. Stable stochastic attractors arise from extinction and resurrection events that are not predicted by the deterministic description. With this view, we explore the attractors of the regular toggle switch and the exclusive switch, focusing on the effects of cooperative binding and the production of protein in bursts. Our arguments suggest that the stability of lysogeny in the lambda-phage may be influenced by such extinction phenomena.},

abstract = {Frictional effects due to the chain itself, rather than the solvent, may have a significant effect on protein dynamics. Experimentally, such "internal friction" has been investigated by studying folding or binding kinetics at varying solvent viscosity; however, the molecular origin of these effects is hard to pinpoint. We consider the kinetics of disordered glycine-serine and $\alpha$-helix forming alanine peptides and a coarse-grained protein folding model in explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations. By varying the solvent mass over more than two orders of magnitude, we alter only the solvent viscosity and not the folding free energy. Folding dynamics at the near-vanishing solvent viscosities accessible by this approach suggests that solvent and internal friction effects are intrinsically entangled. This finding is rationalized by calculation of the polymer end-to-end distance dynamics from a Rouse model that includes internal friction. An analysis of the friction profile along different reaction coordinates, extracted from the simulation data, demonstrates that internal as well as solvent friction varies substantially along the folding pathways and furthermore suggests a connection between friction and the formation of hydrogen bonds upon folding.},

abstract = {The fact that hydrogen bonds (HBs) can provide major stabilization to transition states (TSs) of enzymatic reactions is well known. However, the nature of HB stabilization has been the subject of a significant controversy. It is not entirely clear if this stabilization is associated with electrostatic effects of preorganized dipoles or with delocalized resonance effects of the so-called low barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB). One of the best test cases for the LBHB proposal is the complex of chymotrypsin and trifluoromethyl ketone (TFK). It has been argued that the pK(a) shift in this system provides an experimental evidence for the LBHB proposal. However, this argument could not be resolved by experimental studies. Here we explore the nature of the Asp102-His57 pair in the chymotrypsin-TFK complex by a systematic computational and conceptual study. We start by defining the LBHB proposal in a unique energy-based way. We show that a consistent analysis must involve a description in terms of the energy of the two resonance structures and their mixing. It is clarified that LBHBs cannot be defined according to strength or distance, because ionic HBs can also be strong and short. Similarly, NMR chemical shifts and fractionation factors cannot be used to identify LBHBs in a conclusive way. It is also clarified that HBs with a significant asymmetry cannot be classified as LBHBs, because this contradicts the assumption of equal pK(a) of the donor and acceptor. Thus, the main issue is the DeltapK(a) and the corresponding energy difference. With this definition in mind, we calculate the free energy surface of proton transfer in this pair and evaluate the energetics of the different ionization states of this system. The calculations are done by both the semimacroscopic version of the protein dipoles Langevin dipoles (PDLD/S-LRA) model and by the empirical valence bond (EVB) method. The calculations establish that the LBHB proposal is not valid in the chymotrypsin-TFK complex and in other serine proteases. Although previous theoretical studies reached similar conclusion, this is the first time that the same set of free energy calculations reproduce all the known pK(a) values and pK(a) changes in the system, while evaluating the energetics and covalent character of the His-Asp system. The present study provides a support to the idea that enzymes work by creating a preorganized polar environment.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations can be used to reveal the detailed conformational behaviors of peptides and proteins. By comparing fragment and full-length protein simulations, we can investigate the role of each peptide segment in the folding process. Here, we take advantage of information regarding the helix formation process from our previous simulations of barnase and protein A as well as new simulations of four helical fragments from these proteins at three different temperatures, starting with both helical and extended structures. Segments with high helical propensity began the folding process by tethering the chain through side chain interactions involving either polar interactions, such as salt bridges, or hydrophobic staples. These tethers were frequently nonnative (i.e., not i --> i + 4 spacing) and provided a scaffold for other residues, thereby limiting the conformational search. The helical structure then propagated on both sides of the tether. Segments with low stability and propensity formed later in the folding process and utilized contacts with other portions of the protein when folding. These helices formed via a tertiary contact-assisted mechanism, primarily via hydrophobic contacts between residues distant in sequence. Thus, segments with different helical propensities appear to play different roles during protein folding. Furthermore, the active role of nonlocal side chains in helix formation highlights why we must move beyond simple hierarchical models of protein folding.},

abstract = {The presence of a solvent-exposed alanine residue stabilizes a helix by 0.4-2 kcal.mol(-1) relative to glycine. Various factors have been suggested to account for the differences in helical propensity, from the higher conformational freedom of glycine sequences in the unfolded state to hydrophobic and van der Waals' stabilization of the alanine side chain in the helical state. We have performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent and exhaustive sampling of model peptides to address the backbone conformational entropy difference between Ala and Gly in the denatured state. The mutation of Ala to Gly leads to an increase in conformational entropy equivalent to approximately 0.4 kcal.mol(-1) in a fully flexible denatured, that is, unfolded, state. But, this energy is closely counterbalanced by the (measured) difference in free energy of transfer of the glycine and alanine side chains from the vapor phase to water so that the unfolded alanine- and glycine-containing peptides are approximately isoenergetic. The helix-stabilizing propensity of Ala relative to Gly thus mainly results from more favorable interactions of Ala in the folded helical structure. The small difference in energetics in the denatured states means that the Phi-values derived from Ala --> Gly scanning of helices are a very good measure of the extent of formation of structure in proteins with little residual structure in the denatured state.},

abstract = {We present an experimental and computational analysis of the folding pathway of the 17th domain of chicken brain alpha-spectrin, R17. Wild-type R17 folds in a two-state manner and the chevron plot (plot of the logarithm of the observed rate constant against concentration of urea) shows essentially linear folding and unfolding arms. A number of mutant proteins, however, show a change in slope of the unfolding arm at high concentration of denaturant, hinting at complexity in the folding landscape. Through a combination of mutational studies and high temperature molecular dynamics simulations we show that the folding of R17 can be described by a model with two sequential transition states separated by an intermediate species. The rate limiting transition state for folding in water has been characterized both through experimental Phi-value analysis and by simulation. In contrast, a detailed analysis of the transition state predicted to dominate under highly denaturing conditions is only possible by simulation.},

abstract = {Titin is a giant, multidomain muscle protein forming a major component of the sarcomere in vertebrate striated muscle. As for many other multidomain proteins, the properties of titin are often studied by characterisation of the constituent domains in isolation. This raises the question of to what extent the properties of the isolated domains are representative of the domains in the wild-type protein. We address this question for the I-band region of titin, which is of particular biological interest due to its role in muscle elasticity, by determining the properties of five immunoglobulin domains from the I-band in three different contexts; firstly as isolated domains with the boundaries defined conservatively, secondly, with a two amino acid extension at both the N and C terminus and thirdly as part of multidomain constructs. We show that adjacent domains in the titin I-band have very different kinetic properties which, in general, undergo only a small change in the presence of neighbouring domains and conclude that, provided that care is taken in the choice of domain boundaries, the properties of the titin I-band are essentially "the sum of its parts". From this and other work we propose that variation in kinetic properties between adjacent domains may be a general property of the I-band thereby preventing misfolding events on muscle relaxation.},

abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

abstract = {In Phi-value analysis, the effects of mutations on the folding kinetics are compared with the corresponding effects on thermodynamic stability to investigate the structure of the protein-folding transition state (TS). Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (totaling 0.65 ms) have been performed for a large set of single-point mutants of a 20-residue three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet peptide. Between 57 and 120 folding events were sampled at near equilibrium for each mutant, allowing for accurate estimates of folding/unfolding rates and stability changes. The Phi values calculated from folding and unfolding rates extracted from the MD trajectories are reliable if the stability loss upon mutation is larger than approximately 0.6 kcal/mol, which is observed for 8 of the 32 single-point mutants. The same heterogeneity of the TS of the wild type was found in the mutated peptides, showing two possible pathways for folding. Single-point mutations can induce significant TS shifts not always detected by Phi-value analysis. Specific nonnative interactions at the TS were observed in most of the peptides studied here. The interpretation of Phi values based on the ratio of atomic contacts at the TS over the native state, which has been used in the past in MD and Monte Carlo simulations, is in agreement with the TS structures of wild-type peptide. However, Phi values tend to overestimate the nativeness of the TS ensemble, when interpreted neglecting the nonnative interactions.},

We slow down its folding in a cryogenic water-ethylene-glycol solvent (-18 to -28??C). The refolding kinetics are probed by small-angle x-ray scattering, circular dichroism, and fluorescence to measure the radius of gyration, the average secondary structure content, and the native packing around the single tryptophan residue. The main resolved kinetic phase of the mutant is probe independent and faster than the main phase observed for the pseudo-wild-type. Excess helical structure formed early on by the mutant may reduce the formation of turns and prevent the formation of compact misfolded states, speeding up the overall folding process. Extrapolation of our main cryogenic folding phase and previous T-jump measurements to 37??C yields nearly the same refolding rate as extrapolated by Oas and co-workers from NMR line-shape data. Taken together, all the data consistently indicate a folding speed limit of ??4.5 ??s for this fast folder. ?? 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

It is shown that there exists a threshold value of chain heterogeneity which separates two qualitatively different types of behavior. For a low degree of heterogeneity the protein globule is like a homopolymer in a collapsed state without definite chain folds: an exponentially large number of folds make a significant contribution to the partition function in this regime. After the threshold heterogeneity has been overcome, the chain freezes drastically but without latent heat; few (approx. 1) frozen states with definite chain folds are thermodynamically dominant in this state. The relation of these results to thermodynamic aspects of protein folding is discussed.},

BSA was found to adopt a more flexible conformational state on the boundary surface of gold nanoparticles as a result of the conformational changes in the bioconjugates. The conformational changes at pH 3.8, 7.0, and 9.0, which corresponded to different isomeric forms of albumin, were investigated, respectively, to probe the pH effect on the conformational changes of BSA in the bioconjugates.

abstract = {The three-dimensional structures of proteins often show a modular architecture comprised of discrete structural regions or domains. Cooperative communication between these regions is important for catalysis, regulation and efficient folding; lack of coupling has been implicated in the formation of fibrils and other misfolding pathologies. How different structural regions of a protein communicate and contribute to a protein's overall energetics and folding, however, is still poorly understood. Here we use a single-molecule optical tweezers approach to induce the selective unfolding of particular regions of T4 lysozyme and monitor the effect on other regions not directly acted on by force. We investigate how the topological organization of a protein (the order of structural elements along the sequence) affects the coupling and folding cooperativity between its domains. To probe the status of the regions not directly subjected to force, we determine the free energy changes during mechanical unfolding using Crooks' fluctuation theorem. We pull on topological variants (circular permutants) and find that the topological organization of the polypeptide chain critically determines the folding cooperativity between domains and thus what parts of the folding/unfolding landscape are explored. We speculate that proteins may have evolved to select certain topologies that increase coupling between regions to avoid areas of the landscape that lead to kinetic trapping and misfolding.},

abstract = {At least nine inherited neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's, are caused by poly(L-glutamine) (polyGln, polyQ) expansions > 35–40 repeats in widely or ubiquitously expressed proteins. Except for their expansions, these proteins have no sequence homologies, and their functions mostly remain unknown. Although each disease is characterized by a distinct pathology specific to a subset of neuronal cells, the formation of neuronal intranuclear aggregates containing protein with an expanded polyQ is the hallmark and common feature to most polyQ disorders. The neurodegeneration is thought to be caused by a toxic gain of function that occurs at the protein level and depends on the length of the expansion: Longer repeats cause earlier age of onset and more severe symptoms. To address whether there is a structural difference between polyQ having < 40 versus > 40 residues, we undertook an X-ray fiber diffraction study of synthetic polyQ peptides having varying numbers of residues: Ac-Q8-NH2, D2Q15K2, K2Q28K2, and K2Q45K2. These particular lengths bracket both the range of normalcy (9–36 repeats) and the pathological (45 repeats), and therefore could be indicative of the structural changes expected in expanded polyQ domains. Contrary to expectations of different length-dependent morphologies, we accounted for all the X-ray patterns by slablike, $\beta$-sheet structures, ∼20 \AA thick in the $\beta$-chain direction, all having similar monoclinic lattices. Moreover, the slab thickness indicates that K2Q45K2, rather than forming a water-filled nanotube, must form multiple reverse turns. Proteins 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Recent results show that these mutations have remarkably diverse and unexpected effects on the structure, activity and native state stability of SOD1. Intriguingly, many mutations seem to have no measurable effect on the biophysical and biochemical properties of SOD1, except for decreasing the net charge of the protein. Thus, it seems likely that different ALS-associated mutations promote SOD1 aggregation by fundamentally distinct mechanisms.

abstract = {The mechanism and thermodynamics of folding of the Src homology 3 (SH3) protein domain are characterized at an atomic level through molecular dynamics with importance sampling. This methodology enables the construction of the folding free energy landscape of the protein as a function of representative reaction coordinates. We observe that folding proceeds in a downhill manner under native conditions, with early compaction and structure formation in the hydrophobic sheet consisting of the three central beta strands of the protein. This state bears considerable resemblance to the experimentally determined transition state for folding. Folding proceeds further with the formation of the second hydrophobic sheet consisting of the terminal strands and the RT loop. The final stages of folding appear to involve the formation of the hydrophobic core through the expulsion of water molecules bridging the two hydrophobic sheets. This work sheds new light on the complementary roles of sequence and topology in governing the folding mechanism of small proteins and provides further support for the role of water in facilitating the late stages in folding.},

abstract = {Describing and understanding the biological function of a protein requires a detailed structural and thermodynamic description of the protein's native state ensemble. Obtaining such a description often involves characterizing equilibrium fluctuations that occur beyond the nanosecond timescale. Capturing such fluctuations remains nontrivial even for very long molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. We propose a novel multiscale computational method to exhaustively characterize, in atomistic detail, the protein conformations constituting the native state with no inherent timescale limitations. Applications of this method to proteins of various folds and sizes show that thermodynamic observables measured as averages over the native state ensembles obtained by the method agree remarkably well with nuclear magnetic resonance data that span multiple timescales. By characterizing equilibrium fluctuations at atomistic detail over a broad range of timescales, from picoseconds to milliseconds, our method offers to complement current simulation techniques and wet-lab experiments and can impact our understanding and description of the relationship between protein flexibility and function.},

abstract = {Here, the methods of continuum electrostatics are used to investigate the contribution of electrostatic interactions to the binding of four protein-protein complexes; barnase-barstar, human growth hormone and its receptor, subtype N9 influenza virus neuraminidase and the NC41 antibody, the Ras binding domain (RBD) of kinase cRaf and a Ras homologue Rap1A. In two of the four complexes electrostatics are found to strongly oppose binding (hormone-receptor and neuraminidase-antibody complexes), in one case the net effect is close to zero (barnase-barstar) and in one case electrostatics provides a significant driving force favoring binding (RBD-Rap1A). In order to help understand the wide range of electrostatic contributions that were calculated, the electrostatic free energy was partitioned into contributions of individual charged and polar residues, salt bridges and networks involving salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. Although there is no one structural feature that accounts for the differences between the four interfaces, the extent to which the desolvation of buried charges is compensated by the formation of hydrogen bonds and ion pairs appears to be an important factor. Structural features that are correlated with contribution of an individual residue to stability are also discussed. These include partial burial of a charged group in the free monomer, the formation of networks involving charged and polar amino acids, and the formation of partially exposed ion-pairs. The total electrostatic contribution to binding is found to be inversely correlated with buried total and non-polar surface area. This suggests that different interfaces can be designed to exploit electrostatic and hydrophobic forces in very different ways.},

We demonstrate that the relative entropy serves as a generating function for principles in variational mean-field theory and uniqueness and gives intuitive results for simple case scenarios in model development. Moreover, we suggest that the relative entropy provides a rigorous framework for multiscale simulations and offers new numerical techniques for linking models at different scales. Finally, we show that S(rel) carries physical significance by using it to quantify the deviations of a three-site model of water from simple liquids, finding that the relative entropy, a thermodynamic concept, even predicts water's kinetic anomalies.},

abstract = {Recent efforts have shown that the dynamic properties of a wide class of liquids can be mapped onto semi-universal scaling laws and constitutive relations that are motivated by thermodynamic analyses of much simpler models. In particular, it has been found that many systems exhibit dynamics whose behavior in state space closely follows that of soft-sphere particles interacting through an inverse power repulsion. In the present work, we show that a recently developed coarse-graining theory provides a natural way to understand how arbitrary liquids can be mapped onto effective soft-sphere models and hence how one might potentially be able to extract underlying dynamical scaling laws. The theory is based on the relative entropy, an information metric that quantifies how well a soft-sphere approximation to a liquid's multidimensional potential energy landscape performs. We show that optimization of the relative entropy not only enables one to extract effective soft-sphere potentials that suggest an inherent scaling of thermodynamic and dynamic properties in temperature-density space, but that also has rather interesting connections to excess entropy based theories of liquid dynamics. We apply the approach to a binary mixture of Lennard-Jones particles, and show that it gives effective soft-sphere scaling laws that well-describe the behavior of the diffusion constants. Our results suggest that the relative entropy formalism may be useful for "perturbative" type theories of dynamics, offering a general strategy for systematically connecting complex energy landscapes to simpler reference ones with better understood dynamic behavior.},

Macromolecules 1985;18:534], and the 2-monomer HP model of Lau and Dill [Lau KF, Dill KA. Macromolecules 1989;22:3986]. Our results indicate significant differences among the energy functions in terms of the "smoothness" of their landscapes. In particular, one of the Miyazawa-Jernigan contact potentials reveals unusual cooperative behavior among its species' interactions, resulting in what is essentially a set of phase transitions in sequence space. Our calculations suggest that model-specific features can have a profound effect on protein design algorithms, and our methods offer a number of ways by which sequence landscapes can be quantified.},

Abundantly represented in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and mammalian genomes, PDZ domains are frequently found in multiple copies or are associated with other protein- binding motifs in multidomain scaffold proteins. PDZ-containing proteins are typically involved in the assembly of supramolecular complexes that perform localized signaling functions at particular subcellular locations. Organization around aPDZ-basedscaffold allows the stable localization of interacting proteins and enhances the rate and fidelity of signal transduction within the complex. Some PDZ-containing proteins are more dynamically regulated in distribution and may also be involved in the trafficking of interacting proteins within the cell.},

The estimator, which we call the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (MBAR) because it reduces to the Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (BAR) when only two states are considered, has significant advantages over multiple histogram reweighting methods for combining data from multiple states. It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias.},

abstract = {We present a new estimator for computing free energy differences and thermodynamic expectations as well as their uncertainties from samples obtained from multiple equilibrium states via either simulation or experiment. The estimator, which we call the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (MBAR) because it reduces to the Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (BAR) when only two states are considered, has significant advantages over multiple histogram reweighting methods for combining data from multiple states. It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias.},

abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated the Bennett acceptance ratio method is the best asymptotically unbiased method for determining the equilibrium free energy between two end states given work distributions collected from either equilibrium and nonequilibrium data. However, it is still not clear what the practical advantage of this acceptance ratio method is over other common methods in atomistic simulations. In this study, we first review theoretical estimates of the bias and variance of exponential averaging (EXP), thermodynamic integration (TI), and the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR). In the process, we present a new simple scheme for computing the variance and bias of many estimators, and demonstrate the connections between BAR and the weighted histogram analysis method. Next, a series of analytically solvable toy problems is examined to shed more light on the relative performance in terms of the bias and efficiency of these three methods. Interestingly, it is impossible to conclusively identify a "best" method for calculating the free energy, as each of the three methods performs more efficiently than the others in at least one situation examined in these toy problems. Finally, sample problems of the insertion/deletion of both a Lennard-Jones particle and a much larger molecule in TIP3P water are examined by these three methods. In all tests of atomistic systems, free energies obtained with BAR have significantly lower bias and smaller variance than when using EXP or TI, especially when the overlap in phase space between end states is small. For example, BAR can extract as much information from multiple fast, far-from-equilibrium simulations as from fewer simulations near equilibrium, which EXP cannot. Although TI and sometimes even EXP can be somewhat more efficient in idealized toy problems, in the realistic atomistic situations tested in this paper, BAR is significantly more efficient than all other methods.},

abstract = {Protein folding and binding are kindred processes. Many proteins in the cell are unfolded, so folding and function are coupled. This paper investigates how binding kinetics is influenced by the folding of a protein. We find that a relatively unstructured protein molecule can have a greater capture radius for a specific binding site than the folded state with its restricted conformational freedom. In this scenario of binding, the unfolded state binds weakly at a relatively large distance followed by folding as the protein approaches the binding site: the "fly-casting mechanism." We illustrate this scenario with the hypothetical kinetics of binding a single repressor molecule to a DNA site and find that the binding rate can be significantly enhanced over the rate of binding of a fully folded protein.},

abstract = {Ion channels are characterized by inherently stochastic behavior which can be represented by continuous-time Markov models (CTMM). Although methods for collecting data from single ion channels are available, translating a time series of open and closed channels to a CTMM remains a challenge. Bayesian statistics combined with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling provide means for estimating the rate constants of a CTMM directly from single channel data. In this article, different approaches for the MCMC sampling of Markov models are combined. This method, new to our knowledge, detects overparameterizations and gives more accurate results than existing MCMC methods. It shows similar performance as QuB-MIL, which indicates that it also compares well with maximum likelihood estimators. Data collected from an inositol trisphosphate receptor is used to demonstrate how the best model for a given data set can be found in practice. © 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

The 10th FN-III domain from fibronectin (fnFN10) and the 3rd FN-III domain from tenascin-C (tnFN3) have 27\% sequence identity and the same overall fold; however, the CC' loop has a different pattern of backbone hydrogen bonds and the FG loop is longer in fnFN10 compared to tnFN3. To examine the influence of length, sequence, and context in determining dynamical properties of loops, CC' and FG loops were swapped between fnFN10 and tnFN3 to generate four mutant proteins and backbone conformational dynamics on ps-ns and mus-ms timescales were characterized by solution (15)N-NMR spin relaxation spectroscopy. The grafted loops do not strongly perturb the properties of the protein scaffold; however, specific effects of the mutations are observed for amino acids that are proximal in space to the sites of mutation. The amino acid sequence primarily dictates conformational dynamics when the wild-type and grafted loop have the same length, but both sequence and context contribute to conformational dynamics when the loop lengths differ. The results suggest that changes in conformational dynamics of mutant proteins must be considered in both theoretical studies and protein design efforts.},

It controls protein folding and prevents aggregation, but it also plays a role in cancer and neurological disorders, making it an attractive drug target. Experimental efforts have demonstrated its remarkable structural flexibility and conformational complexity, which enable it to accommodate a variety of clients, but have not been able to provide a detailed molecular description of the conformational transitions. In our molecular dynamics simulations, Hsp90 underwent dramatic structural rearrangements into energetically favorable stretched and compact states. The transitions were guided by key electrostatic interactions between specific residues of opposite subunits. Nucleotide-bound structures showed the same conformational flexibility, although ADP and ATP seemed to potentiate these interactions by stabilizing two different closed conformations. Our observations may explain the difference in dynamic behavior observed among Hsp90 homologs, and the atomic resolution of the conformational transitions helps elucidate the complex chaperone machinery.},

An important feature of these receptors is their capacity for allosteric regulation by small molecules, such as zinc, which bind to their amino-terminal domain (ATD). Zinc inhibition through high affinity binding to the ATD has been examined through functional studies; however, there is no direct measurement of associated conformational changes. We used luminescence resonance energy transfer to show that the ATDs undergo a cleft closure-like conformational change upon binding zinc, but no changes are observed in intersubunit distances. Furthermore, we find that the ATDs are more closely packed than the related AMPA receptors. These results suggest that the stability of the upper lobe contacts between ATDs allow for the efficient propagation of the cleft closure conformational change toward the ligand-binding domain and transmembrane segments, ultimately inhibiting the channel.},

abstract = {Atomically detailed descriptions of ionic solution, membrane, and the gramicidin channel are used to compute molecular dynamics trajectories of ion permeation. The microsecond trajectories are calculated with the Stochastic Difference Equation (SDE), which provides approximate solutions to the equations of motions (with filtered high-frequency modes) of extended timescales. The relative permeations of lithium, sodium, and potassium are estimated by using a novel, kinetic cycle protocol and are compared with experiment. The transport through native gramicidin and one fluoro-valine variant is considered as well. Qualitative agreement between theory and experiment is obtained. The faster permeation rate of sodium compared to lithium is reproduced in the calculations. The calculations also reproduce the slower diffusion through a gramicidin with fluorinated valine compared to native gramicidin. The calculations are inconclusive about the relative rates of potassium and sodium. The experiment suggests that potassium permeates more quickly. We directly probe the kinetics of a biophysical process at a relevant time window without reducing the atomically detailed description of the system. The calculations were able to capture subtle balances between binding and diffusion that determine permeation rates. The same model gave the correct ordering of diffusion rates for cases in which electrostatic binding has opposite effects and must be supplemented by dynamic factors. Diffusion rates are faster when favorable electrostatic interactions of ions in the channel (compared to the solvent) are observed. Studies of a gramicidin variant suggest an opposite effect, in which permeation is faster for the less polar channel, indicating dynamic effects. Although both trends can be explained qualitatively, it is not possible to predict (before doing the SDE calculations) which factor is more important.},

abstract = {The use of so-called protein scaffolds has recently attracted considerable attention in biochemistry in the context of generating novel types of ligand receptors for various applications in research and medicine. This development started with the notion that immunoglobulins owe their function to the composition of a conserved framework region and a spatially well-defined antigen-binding site made of peptide segments that are hypervariable both in sequence and in conformation. After the application of antibody engineering methods along with library techniques had resulted in first successes in the selection of functional antibody fragments, several laboratories began to exploit other types of protein architectures for the construction of practically useful binding proteins. Properties like small size of the receptor protein, stability and ease of production were the focus of this work. Hence, among others, single domains of antibodies or of the immunoglobulin superfamily, protease inhibitors, helix-bundle proteins, disulphide-knotted peptides and lipocalins were investigated. Recently, the scaffold concept has even been adopted for the construction of enzymes. However, it appears that not all kinds of polypeptide fold which may appear attractive for the engineering of loop regions at a first glance will indeed permit the construction of independent ligand-binding sites with high affinities and specificities. This review will therefore concentrate on the critical description of the structural properties of experimentally tested protein scaffolds and of the novel functions that have been achieved on their basis, rather than on the methodology of how to best select a particular mutant with a certain activity. An overview will be provided about the current approaches, and some emerging trends will be identified. (c) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

@article{Skolnick1997,
abstract = {Many existing derivations of knowledge-based statistical pair potentials invoke the quasichemical approximation to estimate the expected side-chain contact frequency if there were no amino acid pair-specific interactions. At first glance, the quasichemical approximation that treats the residues in a protein as being disconnected and expresses the side-chain contact probability as being proportional to the product of the mole fractions of the pair of residues would appear to be rather severe. To investigate the validity of this approximation, we introduce two new reference states in which no specific pair interactions between amino acids are allowed, but in which the connectivity of the protein chain is retained. The first estimates the expected number of side-chain contracts by treating the protein as a Gaussian random coil polymer. The second, more realistic reference state includes the effects of chain connectivity, secondary structure, and chain compactness by estimating the expected side-chain contrast probability by placing the sequence of interest in each member of a library of structures of comparable compactness to the native conformation. The side-chain contact maps are not allowed to readjust to the sequence of interest, i.e., the side chains cannot repack. This situation would hold rigorously if all amino acids were the same size. Both reference states effectively permit the factorization of the side-chain contact probability into sequence-dependent and structure-dependent terms. Then, because the sequence distribution of amino acids in proteins is random, the quasichemical approximation to each of these reference states is shown to be excellent. Thus, the range of validity of the quasichemical approximation is determined by the magnitude of the side-chain repacking term, which is, at present, unknown. Finally, the performance of these two sets of pair interaction potentials as well as side-chain contact fraction-based interaction scales is assessed by inverse folding tests both without and with allowing for gaps.},

Thus, it should be possible to water-solubilize membrane proteins by mutating their lipid-contacting side chains to more polar groups. Here, a computational approach was used to generate water-soluble variants of the potassium channel KcsA. As a probe of the correctness of the fold, the proteins contain an agitoxin2 binding site from a mammalian homologue of the channel. The resulting proteins express in high yield in Escherichia coli and share the intended functional and structural properties with KcsA, including secondary structure, tetrameric quaternary structure, and tight specific binding to both agitoxin2 and a small molecule channel blocker.},

abstract = {The pressure-temperature phase diagram of various biomolecules is reviewed. Special attention is focused on the elliptic phase diagram of proteins. The phenomenological thermodynamic theory describing this diagram explains the heat, cold and pressure denaturations in a unified picture. The limitations and possible developments of this theory are discussed as well. It is pointed out that a more complex diagram can be obtained when the intermolecular interactions are also taken into account. In this case metastable states appear on the pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram due to intermolecular interactions. Pressure-temperature phase diagrams of other biopolymers are also discussed. While the p-T diagrams of helix-coil transition of nucleic acids and of gel-liquid crystal transition of lipid bilayers are non-elliptical, those of gelatinization of starch and of phase separation of some synthetic polymers show an elliptic profile, similar to that of proteins. Finally, the p-T diagram of bacterial inactivation is shown to be elliptic. From the point of view of basic science, this fact shows that the key factor of inactivation should be the protein type, and from the viewpoint of practical applications, it serves as the theoretical basis of pressure treatment of biosystems.},

abstract = {Incorporation of effective backbone sampling into protein simulation and design is an important step in increasing the accuracy of computational protein modeling. Recent analysis of high-resolution crystal structures has suggested a new model, termed backrub, to describe localized, hinge-like alternative backbone and side-chain conformations observed in the crystal lattice. The model involves internal backbone rotations about axes between C-alpha atoms. Based on this observation, we have implemented a backrub-inspired sampling method in the Rosetta structure prediction and design program. We evaluate this model of backbone flexibility using three different tests. First, we show that Rosetta backrub simulations recapitulate the correlation between backbone and side-chain conformations in the high-resolution crystal structures upon which the model was based. As a second test of backrub sampling, we show that backbone flexibility improves the accuracy of predicting point-mutant side-chain conformations over fixed backbone rotameric sampling alone. Finally, we show that backrub sampling of triosephosphate isomerase loop 6 can capture the millisecond/microsecond oscillation between the open and closed states observed in solution. Our results suggest that backrub sampling captures a sizable fraction of localized conformational changes that occur in natural proteins. Application of this simple model of backbone motions may significantly improve both protein design and atomistic simulations of localized protein flexibility.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: New software has been designed to assist the molecular biologist in understanding the structural consequences of modifying a ligand and/or protein.

RESULTS: Tools are described for the analysis of ligand-protein contacts (LPC software) and contacts of structural units (CSU software) such as helices, sheets, strands and residues. Our approach is based on a detailed analysis of interatomic contacts and interface complementarity. For any ligand or structural unit, these software automatically: (i) calculate the solvent-accessible surface of every atom; (ii) determine the contacting residues and type of interaction they undergo (hydrophobic-hydrophobic, aromatic-aromatic, etc.); (iii) indicate all putative hydrogen bonds. LPC software further predicts changes in binding strength following chemical modification of the ligand.

AVAILABILITY: Both LPC and CSU can be accessed through the PDB and are integrated in the 3DB Atlas page of all PDB files. For any given file, the tools can also be accessed at http://www.pdb.bnl. gov/pdb-bin/lpc?PDB\_ID= and http://www.pdb.bnl. gov/pdb-bin/csu?PDB\_ID= with the four-letter PDB code added at the end in each case.

abstract = {Ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate most excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system and function by opening a transmembrane ion channel upon binding of glutamate. Despite their crucial role in neurobiology, the architecture and atomic structure of an intact ionotropic glutamate receptor are unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)-sensitive, homotetrameric, rat GluA2 receptor at 3.6 A resolution in complex with a competitive antagonist. The receptor harbours an overall axis of two-fold symmetry with the extracellular domains organized as pairs of local dimers and with the ion channel domain exhibiting four-fold symmetry. A symmetry mismatch between the extracellular and ion channel domains is mediated by two pairs of conformationally distinct subunits, A/C and B/D. Therefore, the stereochemical manner in which the A/C subunits are coupled to the ion channel gate is different from the B/D subunits. Guided by the GluA2 structure and site-directed cysteine mutagenesis, we suggest that GluN1 and GluN2A NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors have a similar architecture, with subunits arranged in a 1-2-1-2 pattern. We exploit the GluA2 structure to develop mechanisms of ion channel activation, desensitization and inhibition by non-competitive antagonists and pore blockers.},

abstract = {An important idea that emerges from the energy landscape theory of protein folding is that subtle global features of the protein landscape can profoundly affect the apparent mechanism of folding. The relationship between various characteristic temperatures in the phase diagrams and landmarks in the folding funnel at fixed temperatures can be used to classify different folding behaviors. The one-dimensional picture of a folding funnel classifies folding kinetics into four basic scenarios, depending on the relative location of the thermodynamic barrier and the glass transition as a function of a single-order parameter. However, the folding mechanism may not always be quantitatively described by a single-order parameter. Several other order parameters, such as degree of secondary structure formation, collapse and topological order, are needed to establish the connection between minimalist models and proteins in the laboratory. In this article we describe a simple multidimensional funnel based on two-order parameters that measure the degree of collapse and topological order. The appearance of several different "mechanisms" is illustrated by analyzing lattice models with different potentials and sequences with different degrees of design. In most cases, the two-dimensional analysis leads to a classification of mechanisms totally in keeping with the one-dimensional scheme, but a topologically distinct scenario of fast folding with traps also emerges. The nature of traps depends on the relative location of the glass transition surface and the thermodynamic barrier in the multidimensional funnel.},

We also explore the effect of varying the breaking strain and adhesion strength of the constituent amyloid fibrils on the properties of the larger structure. We find that deformation in the nanowires is controlled by a combination of fibril sliding and fibril failure and that there exists a transition from brittle to ductile behavior by either increasing the fibril failure strain or decreasing the strength of adhesion between fibrils. Furthermore, our results reveal that the mechanical properties of the nanowires are quite sensitive to changes in the properties of the individual fibrils, and the larger scale structures are found to be more mechanically robust than the constituent fibrils, for all cases considered.

abstract = {We show that statistical potentials and threading score functions, derived from finite data sets, are informatic functions, and that their performance depends on the manner in which data are classified and compressed. The choice of sequence and structural parameters affects estimates of the conditional probabilities P(C|S), the quantification of the effect of sequence S on conformation C, and determines the amount of information extracted from the data set, as measured by information gain. The mathematical link between information gain and mean conformational energy, established in this work using the local backbone potential as model, demonstrates that manipulation of descriptive parameters also alters the "energy" values assigned to native conformation and to decoy structures in the test pool, and consequently, the performance of such statistical potential functions in fold recognition exercises. We show that sequence and structural partitions that maximize information gain also minimize the mean energy of the ensemble of native conformations. Moreover, we establish an informatic basis for the placement of the native score within an energy spectrum given by the decoy pool in a threading exercise. We discover that, among all informatic quantities, information gain is the best predictor of threading success, even better than the standard Z-score. Consequently, the choices of sequence and structural descriptors, extent of compression, and levels of discretization that maximize information gain must also produce the best potential functions. Strategies to optimize these parameters with respect to information extraction are therefore relevant to building better statistical potentials. Last, we demonstrate that the backbone torsion potential, defined by the trimer sequence, can be an effective tool in greatly reducing the set of possible conformations from a vast decoy pool.},

abstract = {The traditional approach to studying protein folding involves applying a perturbation, usually denaturant or mutation, and determining the effect upon the free energy of folding, DeltaG0, and the activation free energy, DeltaG(not equal). Data collected as a function of the perturbation can be used to construct rate equilibrium free-energy relationships, which report on the development of interactions in the transition state for folding. We examine the use of the ionic-strength-dependent rate equilibrium free-energy relationship in protein folding using the N-terminal domain of L9, a small alpha-beta protein, as a model system. Folding is two-state for the range of ionic strength examined, 0.045-1.52 M. The plot of DeltaG(not equal) versus DeltaG0 is linear (r2= 0.918), with a slope equal to 0.45. The relatively low value of the slope indicates that the ionic-strength-dependent interactions are modestly developed in the transition state. The slope is, however, greater than that of a plot of DeltaG(not equal) versus DeltaG0 constructed by varying pH, thus demonstrating directly that ionic-strength-dependent studies probe more than simple electrostatic interactions. Potential transition movement was probed by analysis of the denaturant, ionic strength cross-interaction parameters. The values are small but nonzero and positive, suggesting a small shift of the transition state toward the native state as the protein is destabilized, i.e., Hammond behavior. The complications that arise in the interpretation of ionic-strength-dependent rate equilibrium free-energy relationships are discussed, and it is concluded that the ionic-strength-dependent studies do not provide a reliable indicator of the role of electrostatic interactions. Complications include incomplete screening of electrostatic interactions, specific ion binding, Hofmeister effects, and the potential presence of electrostatic interactions in the denatured state ensemble.},

abstract = {Plectin is a large and versatile cytoskeletal linker and member of the plakin protein family. Plakins share a conserved region called the plakin domain located near their N terminus. We have determined the crystal structure of an N-terminal fragment of the plakin domain of plectin to 2.05 \AA resolution. This region is adjacent to the actin-binding domain and is required for efficient binding to the integrin $\alpha$6$\beta$4 in hemidesmosomes. The structure is formed by two spectrin repeats connected by an $\alpha$-helix that spans these two repeats. While the first repeat is very similar to other known structures, the second repeat is structurally different with a hydrophobic core, narrower than that in canonical spectrin repeats. Sequence analysis of the plakin domain revealed the presence of up to nine consecutive spectrin repeats organized in an array of tandem modules, and a Src-homology 3 domain inserted in the central spectrin repeat. The structure of the plakin domain is reminiscent of the modular organization of members of the spectrin family. The architecture of the plakin domain suggests that it forms an elongated and flexible structure, and provides a novel molecular explanation for the contribution of plectin and other plakins to the elasticity and stability of tissues subjected to mechanical stress, such as the skin and striated muscle. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we use the combination of single-molecule F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer, nanosecond fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and microfluidic mixing to determine the reconfiguration times of unfolded proteins and investigate the mechanisms of internal friction contributing to their dynamics. Using concepts from polymer dynamics, we determine internal friction with three complementary, largely independent, and consistent approaches as an additive contribution to the reconfiguration time of the unfolded state.

abstract = {The four-helical protein Im7 folds via a rapidly formed on-pathway intermediate (k(UI)=3000 s(-1) at pH 7.0, 10 degrees C) that contains three (helices I, II and IV) of the four native alpha-helices. The relatively slow (k(IN)=300 s(-1)) conversion of this intermediate into the native structure is driven by the folding and docking of the six residue helix III onto the developing hydrophobic core. Here, we describe the structural properties of four Im7* variants designed to trap the protein in the intermediate state by disrupting the stabilising interactions formed between helix III and the rest of the protein structure. In two of these variants (I54A and L53AI54A), hydrophobic residues within helix III have been mutated to alanine, whilst in the other two mutants the sequence encompassing the native helix III was replaced by a glycine linker, three (H3G3) or six (H3G6) residues in length. All four variants were shown to be monomeric, as judged by analytical ultracentrifugation, and highly helical as measured by far-UV CD. In addition, all the variants denature co-operatively and have a stability (DeltaG(UF)) and buried hydrophobic surface area (M(UF)) similar to those of the on-pathway kinetic intermediate. Structural characterisation of these variants using 1-anilino-8-napthalene sulphonic acid (ANS) binding, near-UV CD and 1D (1)H NMR demonstrate further that the trapped intermediate ensemble is highly structured with little exposed hydrophobic surface area. Interestingly, however, the structural properties of the variants I54A and L53AI54A differ in detail from those of H3G3 and H3G6. In particular, the single tryptophan residue, located near the end of helix IV, and distant from helix III, is in a distinct environment in the two sets of mutants as judged by fluorescence, near-UV CD and the sensitivity of tryptophan fluorescence to iodide quenching. Overall, the results confirm previous kinetic analysis that demonstrated the hierarchical folding of Im7 via an on-pathway intermediate, and show that this species is a highly helical ensemble with a well-formed hydrophobic core. By contrast with the native state, however, the intermediate ensemble is flexible enough to change in response to mutation, its structural properties being tailored by residues in the sequence encompassing the native helix III.},

abstract = {The intersection of ethics, law, business and computer software is the subject of these essays and speeches by MacArthur Foundation Grant winner, Richard M. Stallman. This collection includes historical writings such as The GNU Manifesto, which defined and launched the activist Free Software Movement, along with new writings on hot topics in copyright, patent law, and the controversial issue of "trusted computing." Stallman takes a critical look at common abuses of copyright law and patents when applied to computer software programs, and how these abuses damage our entire society and remove our existing freedoms. He also discusses the social aspects of software and how free software can create community and social justice. Given the current turmoil in copyright and patent laws, including the DMCA and proposed CBDTPA, these essays are more relevant than ever. Stallman tackles head-on the essential issues driving the current changes in copyright law. He argues that for creativity to flourish, software must be free of inappropriate and overly-broad legal constraints. Over the past twenty years his arguments and actions have changed the course of software history; this new book is sure to impact the future of software and legal policies in the years to come.},

abstract = {The automatic classification of the wealth of molecular configurations gathered in simulation in the form of a few coordinates that help to explain the main states and transitions of the system is a recurring problem in computational molecular biophysics. We use the recently proposed ScIMAP algorithm to automatically extract motion parameters from simulation data. The procedure uses only molecular shape similarity and topology information inferred directly from the simulated conformations, and is not biased by a priori known information. The automatically recovered coordinates prove as excellent reaction coordinates for the molecules studied and can be used to identify stable states and transitions, and as a basis to build free-energy surfaces. The coordinates provide a better description of the free energy landscape when compared with coordinates computed using principal components analysis, the most popular linear dimensionality reduction technique. The method is first validated on the analysis of the dynamics of an all-atom model of alanine dipeptide, where it successfully recover all previously known metastable states. When applied to characterize the simulated folding of a coarse-grained model of beta-hairpin, in addition to the folded and unfolded states, two symmetric misfolding crossings of the hairpin strands are observed, together with the most likely transitions from one to the other.},

Instead of modeling the kinetics in the time domain, it can be advantageous to perform a numerical inversion leading to a rate distribution function f(lambda).

We discuss different numerical techniques for obtaining rate distribution functions, with special emphasis on the maximum entropy method.

abstract = {A hybrid analysis that combines the maximum entropy method (MEM) with nonlinear least squares (NLS) fitting has been developed to interpret a general time-dependent signal. Data that include processes of opposite sign and a slow baseline drift can be inverted to obtain both a continuous distribution of lifetimes and a sum of discrete exponentials. Fits by discrete exponentials are performed with initial parameters determined from the distribution of lifetimes obtained with the MEM. The regularization of the parameter space achieved by the MEM stabilizes the introduction of each successive exponential in the NLS fits. This hybrid approach is particularly useful when fitting by a large number of exponentials. Revision of the MEM "prior" based on features in the data can improve the lifetime distribution obtained. Standard errors in the mean are estimated automatically for raw data. The results presented for simulated data and for fluorescence measurements of protein folding illustrate the utility and accuracy of the hybrid algorithm. Analysis of the folding of dihydrofolate reductase reveals six kinetic processes, one more than previously reported.},

Despite the intuition that the rules of English spelling are highly combinatorial and arbitrary, we find that maximum entropy models consistent with pairwise correlations among letters provide a surprisingly good approximation to the full statistics of words, capturing ∼92\% of the multi-information in four-letter words and even "discovering" words that were not represented in the data. These maximum entropy models incorporate letter interactions through a set of pairwise potentials and thus define an energy landscape on the space of possible words. Guided by the large letter redundancy we seek a lower-dimensional encoding of the letter distribution and show that distinctions between local minima in the landscape account for ∼68\% of the four-letter entropy. We suggest that these states provide an effective vocabulary which is matched to the frequency of word use and much smaller than the full lexicon.},

We examine the implications of the interplay between the growing $\xi$($\alpha$) and the size of the crystal nucleus, $\xi$(M), which shrinks on cooling. We argue that at low temperatures where $\xi$($\alpha$) > $\xi$(M) a new crystallization mechanism emerges, enabling rapid development of a large scale web of sparsely connected crystallinity. Though we predict this web percolates the system at too low a temperature to be easily seen in the laboratory, there are noticeable residual effects near the glass transition that can account for several previously observed unexplained phenomena of deeply supercooled liquids including Fischer clusters and anomalous crystal growth near T(g).},

abstract = {In order to elucidate the relative importance of secondary structure and topology in determining folding mechanism, we have carried out a phi-value analysis of the death domain (DD) from human FADD. FADD DD is a 100 amino acid domain consisting of six anti-parallel alpha helices arranged in a Greek key structure. We asked how does the folding of this domain compare with that of (a) other all-alpha-helical proteins and (b) other Greek key proteins? Is the folding pathway determined mainly by secondary structure or is topology the principal determinant? Our Phi-value analysis reveals a striking resemblance to the all-beta Greek key immunoglobulin-like domains. Both fold via diffuse transition states and, importantly, long-range interactions between the four central elements of secondary structure are established in the transition state. The elements of secondary structure that are less tightly associated with the central core are less well packed in both cases. Topology appears to be the dominant factor in determining the pathway of folding in all Greek key domains.},

abstract = {We show how to apply a general theoretical approach to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, called Maximum Caliber, originally suggested by E. T. Jaynes [Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 31, 579 (1980)], to a problem of two-state dynamics. Maximum Caliber is a variational principle for dynamics in the same spirit that Maximum Entropy is a variational principle for equilibrium statistical mechanics. The central idea is to compute a dynamical partition function, a sum of weights over all microscopic paths, rather than over microstates. We illustrate the method on the simple problem of two-state dynamics, A<-->B, first for a single particle, then for M particles. Maximum Caliber gives a unified framework for deriving all the relevant dynamical properties, including the microtrajectories and all the moments of the time-dependent probability density. While it can readily be used to derive the traditional master equation and the Langevin results, it goes beyond them in also giving trajectory information. For example, we derive the Langevin noise distribution rather than assuming it. As a general approach to solving nonequilibrium statistical mechanics dynamical problems, Maximum Caliber has some advantages: (1) It is partition-function-based, so we can draw insights from similarities to equilibrium statistical mechanics. (2) It is trajectory-based, so it gives more dynamical information than population-based approaches like master equations; this is particularly important for few-particle and single-molecule systems. (3) It gives an unambiguous way to relate flows to forces, which has traditionally posed challenges. (4) Like Maximum Entropy, it may be useful for data analysis, specifically for time-dependent phenomena.},

abstract = {Protein folding and binding are analogous processes, in which the protein 'searches' for favourable intramolecular or intermolecular interactions on a funnelled energy landscape. Many eukaryotic proteins are disordered under physiological conditions, and fold into ordered structures only on binding to their cellular targets. The mechanism by which folding is coupled to binding is poorly understood, but it has been hypothesized on theoretical grounds that the binding kinetics may be enhanced by a 'fly-casting' effect, where the disordered protein binds weakly and non-specifically to its target and folds as it approaches the cognate binding site. Here we show, using NMR titrations and (15)N relaxation dispersion, that the phosphorylated kinase inducible activation domain (pKID) of the transcription factor CREB forms an ensemble of transient encounter complexes on binding to the KIX domain of the CREB binding protein. The encounter complexes are stabilized primarily by non-specific hydrophobic contacts, and evolve by way of an intermediate to the fully bound state without dissociation from KIX. The carboxy-terminal helix of pKID is only partially folded in the intermediate, and becomes stabilized by intermolecular interactions formed in the final bound state. Future applications of our method will provide new understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which intrinsically disordered proteins perform their diverse biological functions.},

abstract = {Normal mode analysis (NMA) is a powerful tool for predicting the possible movements of a given macromolecule. It has been shown recently that half of the known protein movements can be modelled by using at most two low-frequency normal modes. Applications of NMA cover wide areas of structural biology, such as the study of protein conformational changes upon ligand binding, membrane channel opening and closure, potential movements of the ribosome, and viral capsid maturation. Another, newly emerging field of NMA is related to protein structure determination by X-ray crystallography, where normal mode perturbed models are used as templates for diffraction data phasing through molecular replacement (MR). Here we present ElN\'{e}mo, a web interface to the Elastic Network Model that provides a fast and simple tool to compute, visualize and analyse low-frequency normal modes of large macro-molecules and to generate a large number of different starting models for use in MR. Due to the 'rotation-translation-block' (RTB) approximation implemented in ElN\'{e}mo, there is virtually no upper limit to the size of the proteins that can be treated. Upon input of a protein structure in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format, ElN\'{e}mo computes its 100 lowest-frequency modes and produces a comprehensive set of descriptive parameters and visualizations, such as the degree of collectivity of movement, residue mean square displacements, distance fluctuation maps, and the correlation between observed and normal-mode-derived atomic displacement parameters (B-factors). Any number of normal mode perturbed models for MR can be generated for download. If two conformations of the same (or a homologous) protein are available, ElN\'{e}mo identifies the normal modes that contribute most to the corresponding protein movement. The web server can be freely accessed at http://igs-server.cnrs-mrs.fr/elnemo/index.html.},

abstract = {The Gō-like models of proteins are constructed based on the knowledge of the native conformation. However, there are many possible choices of a Hamiltonian for which the ground state coincides with the native state. Here, we propose to use experimental data on protein stretching to determine what choices are most adequate physically. This criterion is motivated by the fact that stretching processes usually start with the native structure, in the vicinity of which the Gō-like models should work the best. Our selection procedure is applied to 62 different versions of the Gō model and is based on 28 proteins. We consider different potentials, contact maps, local stiffness energies, and energy scales--uniform and nonuniform. In the latter case, the strength of the nonuniformity was governed either by specificity or by properties related to positioning of the side groups. Among them is the simplest variant: uniform couplings with no i, i + 2 contacts. This choice also leads to good folding properties in most cases. We elucidate relationship between the local stiffness described by a potential which involves local chirality and the one which involves dihedral and bond angles. The latter stiffness improves folding but there is little difference between them when it comes to stretching.},

abstract = {Recent experiments have conclusively shown that proteins are able to fold from an unknotted, denatured polypeptide to the knotted, native state without the aid of chaperones. These experiments are consistent with a growing body of theoretical work showing that a funneled, minimally frustrated energy landscape is sufficient to fold small proteins with complex topologies. Here, we present a theoretical investigation of the folding of a knotted protein, 2ouf, engineered in the laboratory by a domain fusion that mimics an evolutionary pathway for knotted proteins. Unlike a previously studied knotted protein of similar length, we see reversible folding/knotting and a surprising lack of deep topological traps with a coarse-grained structure-based model. Our main interest is to investigate how evolution might further select the geometry and stiffness of the threading region of the newly fused protein. We compare the folding of the wild-type protein to several mutants. Similarly to the wild-type protein, all mutants show robust and reversible folding, and knotting coincides with the transition state ensemble. As observed experimentally, our simulations show that the knotted protein folds about ten times slower than an unknotted construct with an identical contact map. Simulated folding kinetics reflect the experimentally observed rollover in the folding limbs of chevron plots. Successful folding of the knotted protein is restricted to a narrow range of temperature as compared to the unknotted protein and fits of the kinetic folding data below folding temperature suggest slow, nondiffusive dynamics for the knotted protein.},

abstract = {Most proteins, in order to perform their biological function, have to fold to a compact native state. The increasing number of knotted and slipknotted proteins identified suggests that proteins are able to manoeuvre around topological barriers during folding. In the present article, we review the current progress in elucidating the knotting process in proteins. Although we concentrate on theoretical approaches, where a knotted topology can be unambiguously detected, comparison with experiments is also reviewed. Numerical simulations suggest that the folding process for small knotted proteins is composed of twisted loop formation and then threading by either slipknot geometries or flipping. As the size of the knotted proteins increases, particularly for more deeply threaded termini, the prevalence of traps in the free energy landscape also increases. Thus, in the case of longer knotted and slipknotted proteins, the folding mechanism is probably supported by chaperones. Overall, results imply that knotted proteins can be folded efficiently and survive evolutionary pressure in order to perform their biological functions.},

abstract = {Proteins with nontrivial topology, containing knots and slipknots, have the ability to fold to their native states without any additional external forces invoked. A mechanism is suggested for folding of these proteins, such as YibK and YbeA, that involves an intermediate configuration with a slipknot. It elucidates the role of topological barriers and backtracking during the folding event. It also illustrates that native contacts are sufficient to guarantee folding in approximately 1-2\% of the simulations, and how slipknot intermediates are needed to reduce the topological bottlenecks. As expected, simulations of proteins with similar structure but with knot removed fold much more efficiently, clearly demonstrating the origin of these topological barriers. Although these studies are based on a simple coarse-grained model, they are already able to extract some of the underlying principles governing folding in such complex topologies.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations supplement single-molecule pulling experiments by providing the possibility of examining the full free energy landscape using many coordinates. Here, we use an all-atom structure-based model to study the force and temperature dependence of the unfolding of the protein filamin by applying force at both termini. The unfolding time-force relation $\tau$(F) indicates that the force-induced unfolding behavior of filamin can be characterized into three regimes: barrier-limited low- and intermediate-force regimes, and a barrierless high-force regime. Slope changes of $\tau$(F) separate the three regimes. We show that the behavior of $\tau$(F) can be understood from a two-dimensional free energy landscape projected onto the extension X and the fraction of native contacts Q. In the low-force regime, the unfolding rate is roughly force-independent due to the small (even negative) separation in X between the native ensemble and transition state ensemble (TSE). In the intermediate-force regime, force sufficiently separates the TSE from the native ensemble such that $\tau$(F) roughly follows an exponential relation. This regime is typically explored by pulling experiments. While X may fail to resolve the TSE due to overlap with the unfolded ensemble just below the folding temperature, the overlap is minimal at lower temperatures where experiments are likely to be conducted. The TSE becomes increasingly structured with force, whereas the average order of structural events during unfolding remains roughly unchanged. The high-force regime is characterized by barrierless unfolding, and the unfolding time approaches a limit of ∼10 $\mu$s for the highest forces we studied. Finally, a combination of X and Q is shown to be a good reaction coordinate for almost the entire force range.},

abstract = {Ligand-gated ion channels transduce chemical signals into electrical impulses by opening a transmembrane pore in response to binding one or more neurotransmitter molecules. After activation, many ligand-gated ion channels enter a desensitized state in which the neurotransmitter remains bound but the ion channel is closed. Although receptor desensitization is crucial to the functioning of many ligand-gated ion channels in vivo, the molecular basis of this important process has until now defied analysis. Using the GluR2 AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptor, we show here that the ligand-binding cores form dimers and that stabilization of the intradimer interface by either mutations or allosteric modulators reduces desensitization. Perturbations that destabilize the interface enhance desensitization. Receptor activation involves conformational changes within each subunit that result in an increase in the separation of portions of the receptor that are linked to the ion channel. Our analysis defines the dimer interface in the resting and activated state, indicates how ligand binding is coupled to gating, and suggests modes of dimer dimer interaction in the assembled tetramer. Desensitization occurs through rearrangement of the dimer interface, which disengages the agonist-induced conformational change in the ligand-binding core from the ion channel gate.},

Here, we investigate a semi-analytical expression of folding that explicitly includes geometrical effects. We consider a Hamiltonian corresponding to a Gaussian filament with structure-based interactions. The model captures local features of protein folding often averaged over by mean-field theories, for example, loop contact formation and excluded volume. We explore the thermodynamics and folding mechanisms of beta-hairpin and alpha-helical structures as functions of temperature and Q, the fraction of native contacts formed. Excluded volume is shown to be an important component of a protein Hamiltonian, since it both dominates the cooperativity of the folding transition and alters folding mechanisms. Understanding geometrical effects in analytical formulae will help illuminate the consequences of the approximations required for the study of larger proteins.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are traditionally associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. However, the ability to form amyloid fibrils appears to be a more generic property of proteins. While disease-related, or pathological, amyloid fibrils are relevant for understanding the pathology and course of the disease, functional amyloids are involved, for example, in the exceptionally strong adhesive properties of natural adhesives. Amyloid fibrils are thus becoming increasingly interesting as versatile nanobiomaterials for applications in biotechnology. In the last decade a number of studies have reported on the intriguing mechanical characteristics of amyloid fibrils. In most of these studies atomic force microscopy (AFM) and atomic force spectroscopy play a central role. AFM techniques make it possible to probe, at nanometer length scales, and with exquisite control over the applied forces, biological samples in different environmental conditions. In this review we describe the different AFM techniques used for probing mechanical properties of single amyloid fibrils on the nanoscale. An overview is given of the existing mechanical studies on amyloid. We discuss the difficulties encountered with respect to the small fibril sizes and polymorphic behavior of amyloid fibrils. In particular, the different conformational packing of monomers within the fibrils leads to a heterogeneity in mechanical properties. We conclude with a brief outlook on how our knowledge of these mechanical properties of the amyloid fibrils can be exploited in the construction of nanomaterials from amyloid fibrils.},

abstract = {Bacteriophage T7 gp4 serves as a model protein for replicative helicases that couples deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) hydrolysis to directional movement and DNA strand separation. We employed single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer methods to resolve steps during DNA unwinding by T7 helicase. We confirm that the unwinding rate of T7 helicase decreases with increasing base pair stability. For duplexes containing >35\% guanine-cytosine (GC) base pairs, we observed stochastic pauses every 2-3 bp during unwinding. The dwells on each pause were distributed nonexponentially, consistent with two or three rounds of dTTP hydrolysis before each unwinding step. Moreover, we observed backward movements of the enzyme on GC-rich DNAs at low dTTP concentrations. Our data suggest a coupling ratio of 1:1 between base pairs unwound and dTTP hydrolysis, and they further support the concept that nucleic acid motors can have a hierarchy of different-sized steps or can accumulate elastic energy before transitioning to a subsequent phase.},

@article{Szep2009,
abstract = {Globular proteins often contain structurally well-resolved internal water molecules. Previously, we reported results from a molecular dynamics study that suggested that buried water (Wat3) may play a role in modulating the structure of the FK506 binding protein-12 (FKBP12) (Park and Saven, Proteins 2005; 60:450-463). In particular, simulations suggested that disrupting a hydrogen bond to Wat3 by mutating E60 to either A or Q would cause a structural perturbation involving the distant W59 side chain, which rotates to a new conformation in response to the mutation. This effectively remodels the ligand-binding pocket, as the side chain in the new conformation is likely to clash with bound FK506. To test whether the protein structure is in effect modulated by the binding of a buried water in the distance, we determined high-resolution (0.92-1.29 A) structures of wild-type FKBP12 and its two mutants (E60A, E60Q) by X-ray crystallography. The structures of mutant FKBP12 show that the ligand-binding pocket is indeed remodeled as predicted by the substitution at position 60, even though the water molecule does not directly interact with any of the amino acids of the binding pocket. Thus, these structures support the view that buried water molecules constitute an integral, noncovalent component of the protein structure. Additionally, this study provides an example in which predictions from molecular dynamics simulations are experimentally validated with atomic precision, thus showing that the structural features of protein-water interactions can be reliably modeled at a molecular level.},

abstract = {We propose a coarse-grained model of proteins that take into account solvent effects and apply it for simulating folding of a three-helix-bundle protein. The energy functional form, refined from our previous work (Takada et al., J Chem Phys 1999;110:11616-11629), tries to closely imitate real physico-chemical interactions. In particular, the hydrogen bond that depends on local dielectric constant, the helix capping effect, and side-chain entropic effects are included. With use of the model, we simulate folding of the GA module of an albumin binding domain, 1prb(7-53), finding most trajectories reach at the native topology within 1 micros. In the simulation, helices 1 and 3 are mostly formed earlier accompanied by non-specific collapse, while second helix is intrinsically less stable and is formed with the help of tertiary contacts at later stage. We compute an analog of the transition state ensemble and compare it with those of other three-helix-bundle proteins. The transition state of 1prb(7-53) includes a few specific tertiary contacts of C terminus of helix 3 with the loop region between helices 1 and 2. This resembles, but is not equivalent to, an early formed region of fragment B of staphylococcal protein A, but is quite different from the folding transient structures of a de novo designed three-helix-bundle peptide.},

abstract = {Recent studies on peptide fibrillogenesis by the de novo method as well as amyloidogenic proteins including prion proteins and Alzheimer's beta-peptides have provided insights into the conformational changes, such as alpha-helix to beta-structure, involved in folding and misfolding processes. We have found that an exposed hydrophobic nucleation domain at N-terminal causes a structural transition of a peptide from alpha-helix to beta-fibril. It became clear that N-terminal acyl groups of particular lengths in a 2alpha-helix peptide caused the peptide to undergo an alpha-to-beta transition. The peptide with the octanoyl group (C8-2alpha) showed the highest rate of transformation. The study of the designed peptides revealed that these alpha-to-beta transitions were closely related to the initial alpha-helix conformation and its stability. Engineering peptides that undergo alpha-to-beta transitions are attractive not only to the study of pathogenic proteins such as prion proteins, but also to the control of self-assembly of peptides, which will lead to the development of peptidyl self-assembling materials.},

Many macromolecular properties are pH dependent, such as activity and stability. However, only activity is biologically important, while stability may not be crucial for the corresponding reaction. Here, we show that the pH-optimum of activity (the pH of maximal activity) is correlated with the pH-optimum of stability (the pH of maximal stability) on a set of 310 proteins with available experimental data. We speculate that such a correlation is needed to allow the corresponding macromolecules to tolerate small pH fluctuations that are inevitable with cellular function. Our findings rationalize the efforts of correlating the pH of maximal stability and the characteristic pH of subcellular compartments, as only pH of activity is subject of evolutionary pressure. In addition, our analysis confirmed the previous observation that pH-optimum of activity and stability are not correlated with the isoelectric point, pI, or with the optimal temperature.},

abstract = {Metals are the most commonly encountered protein cofactors, and they play important structural and functional roles in biology. In many cases, metal binding provides a major driving force for a polypeptide chain to fold. While there are many studies on the structure, stability, and function of metal-binding proteins, there are few studies focusing on understanding the kinetic mechanism of metal-induced folding. Herein, the Zn(2+)-induced folding kinetics of a small zinc-binding protein are studied; the CH1(1) peptide is derived from the first cysteine/histidine-rich region (CH1 domain) of the protein interaction domains of the transcriptional coregulator CREB-binding protein. Computational design is used to introduce tryptophan and histidine mutations that are structurally consistent with CH1(1); these mutants are studied using stopped-flow tryptophan fluorescence experiments. The Zn(2+)-induced CH1(1) folding kinetics are consistent with two parallel pathways, where the initial binding of Zn(2+) occurs at two sites. However, the initially formed Zn(2+)-bound complexes can proceed either directly to the folded state where zinc adopts a tetrahedral coordination or to an off-pathway misligated intermediate. While elimination of those ligands responsible for misligation simplifies the folding kinetics, it also leads to a decrease in the zinc binding constant. Therefore, these results suggest why these nonnative zinc ligands in the CH1(1) motif are conserved in several distantly related organisms and why the requirement for function can lead to kinetic frustration in folding. In addition, the loop closure rate of the CH1(1) peptide is determined based on the proposed model and temperature-dependent kinetic measurements.},

These processes are considered with examples of some unexpected relationships among folds, including circular permutations.

When all the models were compared to a nonredundant set of all known structures, only one-in-ten were found to have a match. This large excess of novel folds was associated with each protein probe and if true in general, implies that the space of possible folds is larger than the space of realized folds, in much the same way that sequence-space is larger than fold-space.

Her writings have been translated into more than two dozen languages, and her books have sold more than fifteen million copies. In 1982 Alice published The Color Purple, now a classic of American literature, for which she was awarded the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (the first African American woman writer to receive this award) and the National Book Award. The award-winning novel served as the inspiration for Steven Spielberg's 1985 film and has been adapted for the stage by Marsha Norman and produced by Scott Sanders. 

عرفت أليس والكر حول العالم من خلال أعمالها التي تضم قصصاً خيالية وقصائد ومقالات هذا بالإضافة إلى كونها ناشطة في مجال حقوق الإنسان. وقد كرستها رواياتها مرجعاً معترفاً به في ما يخص الرسائل الأميركية ورمزاً كبيراً ساهم بحسب الأدباء بنهضة كتابات النساء الأميركيات من أصول إفريقية في فترة السبعينيات من القرن الماضي. ترجمت مؤلفاتها إلى أكثر من 12 لغة كما فاقت مبيعات كتبها ال15 مليون نسخة. نشرت والكر عام 1982 كتابها "اللون البنفسجي" The Color Purple الذي أضحى نموذجاً للأدب الكلاسيكي الأميركي فحصدت عنه جائزة الPulitzer للرواية لعام 1983 (وأصبحت بذلك أول إمرأة أميركية من أصول إفريقية تمنح هذه الجائزة) كما نالت جائزة الNational Book Award. وقد ألهمت هذه القصة الحائزة على منح المخرج الأمريكي ستيفن سبيلبرغ  فحولها فيلماً مصوراً كما تمت إعادة صياغتها لتلائم المسرح من قبل مارشا نورمان والمنتج سكوت ساندرز.

About TEDx,
x = independently organized event
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)

عن تيد أكس
أكس= حدث مستقل منظم ذاتياً
يشكل تيد أكس رام الله عبارة عن برنامج محلي، ينظمه أفراد يؤمنون بأن الأفكار تستحق الإنتشار لأنها تساهم في جمع الناس فيتشاركون تجربة من وحي تجارب تيد. تبث المؤتمرات المنظمة من قبل تيد أكس خطابات تيد على أشرطة الفيديو كما وتعتمد على الخطابات الحية التي يلقيها المتحدثون فتنشط النقاشات العميقة وتشتد الروابط الإنسانية والفكرية في المجموعة الواحدة. وقد صمم البرنامج تحديداً لتحفيز الأفراد كما المنظمات والمجتمعات على تنشيط الحوار. يزود مؤتمر تيد برنامج تيد أكس بالتوجيهات العامة، إلا أن تنظيم مناسبات تيد أكس الفردية يتم بشكل ذاتي.* لذلك تعرف هذه النشاطات المحلية والمنظمة ذاتياً بتيد أكس حيث تصبح أكس عبارة عن حدث مستقل منظم ذاتياً.

abstract = {Kinetic anomalies in protein folding can result from changes of the kinetic ground states (D, I, and N), changes of the protein folding transition state, or both. The 102-residue protein U1A has a symmetrically curved chevron plot which seems to result mainly from changes of the transition state. At low concentrations of denaturant the transition state occurs early in the folding reaction, whereas at high denaturant concentration it moves close to the native structure. In this study we use this movement to follow continuously the formation and growth of U1A's folding nucleus by phi analysis. Although U1A's transition state structure is generally delocalized and displays a typical nucleation-condensation pattern, we can still resolve a sequence of folding events. However, these events are sufficiently coupled to start almost simultaneously throughout the transition state structure.},

abstract = {The formation of amyloid-like aggregates by expanded polyglutamine (polyGln) sequences is suspected to play a critical role in the neuropathology of Huntington's disease and other expanded CAG-repeat diseases. To probe the folding of the polyGln sequence in the aggregate, we replaced Gln-Gln pairs at different sequence intervals with Pro-Gly pairs, elements that are compatible with beta-turn formation and incompatible with beta-extended chain. We find that PGQ9 and PGQ10, peptides consisting of four Q9 or Q10 elements interspersed with PG elements, undergo spontaneous aggregation as efficiently as a Q45 sequence, whereas the corresponding PGQ7 and PGQ8 peptides aggregate much less readily. Furthermore, a PDGQ9 sequence containing d-prolines aggregates more efficiently than the peptide with l-prolines, consistent with beta-turn formation in aggregate structure. Introduction of one additional Pro residue in the center of a Q9 element within PGQ9 completely blocks the peptide's ability to aggregate. This strongly suggests that the Q9 elements are required to be in extended chain for efficient aggregation to occur. We determined the critical nucleus for aggregation nucleation of the PGQ9 peptide to be one, a result identical to that for unbroken polyGln sequences. The PGQN peptide aggregates are structurally quite similar to Q45 aggregates, as judged by heterologous seeding aggregation kinetics, recognition by an anti-polyGln aggregate antibody, and electron microscopy. The results suggest that polyGln aggregate structure consists of alternating elements of extended chain and turn. In the future it should be possible to conduct detailed and interpretable mutational studies in the PGQ9 background.},

@article{Thompson1997,
abstract = {The kinetics of the helix<==>coil transition of an alanine-based peptide following a laser-induced temperature jump were monitored by the fluorescence of an N-terminal probe, 4-(methylamino)benzoic acid (MABA). This probe forms a peptide hydrogen bond to the helix backbone, which changes its fluorescence quantum yield. The MABA fluorescence intensity decreases in a single exponential relaxation, with relaxation times that are weakly temperature dependent, exhibiting a maximum value of approximately 20 ns near the midpoint of the melting transition. We have developed a new model, the kinetic version of the equilibrium 'zipper' model for helix<==>coil transitions to explain these results. In this 'kinetic zipper' model, an enormous reduction in the number of possible species results from the assumption that each molecule contains either no helical residues or a single contiguous region of helix (the single-sequence approximation). The decay of the fraction of N-terminal residues that are helical, calculated from numerical solutions of the kinetic equations which describe the model, can be approximately described by two exponential relaxations having comparable amplitudes. The shorter relaxation time results from rapid unzipping (and zipping) of the helix ends in response to the temperature jump, while the longer relaxation time results from equilibration of helix-containing and non-helix-containing structures by passage over the nucleation free energy barrier. The decay of the average helix content is dominated by the slower process. The model therefore explains the experimental observation that relaxation for the N-terminal fluorescent probe is approximately 8-fold faster than that for the infrared probe of Williams et al. [(1996) Biochemistry 35, 691-697], which measures the average helix content, but does not account for the absence of observable amplitude for the slow relaxation in the fluorescence experiments (<10\% slow phase). If we assume that the activation barrier for the coil-->helix rate is purely entropic, the model can also explain the maximum in the temperature dependence of the relaxation time for the fluorescent probe. Parameters that best reproduce the melting curves and the ratio of relaxation times predict a value of the cooperativity parameter sigma which is approximately 3-fold larger than previously reported values obtained from fitting equilibrium data only. The helix growth rate of approximately 10(8) s-1 that reproduces the experimental relaxation times is approximately 100-fold slower than those observed in molecular dynamics simulations. These parameters can be used to simulate the kinetically cooperative formation of a helix from the all-coil state.},

abstract = {In the simplest view of transcriptional regulation, the expression of a gene is turned on or off by changes in the concentration of a transcription factor (TF). We use recent data on noise levels in gene expression to show that it should be possible to transmit much more than just one regulatory bit. Realizing this optimal information capacity would require that the dynamic range of TF concentrations used by the cell, the input/output relation of the regulatory module, and the noise in gene expression satisfy certain matching relations, which we derive. These results provide parameter-free, quantitative predictions connecting independently measurable quantities. Although we have considered only the simplified problem of a single gene responding to a single TF, we find that these predictions are in surprisingly good agreement with recent experiments on the Bicoid/Hunchback system in the early Drosophila embryo and that this system achieves approximately 90\% of its theoretical maximum information transmission.},

abstract = {Maximum entropy models are the least structured probability distributions that exactly reproduce a chosen set of statistics measured in an interacting network. Here we use this principle to construct probabilistic models which describe the correlated spiking activity of populations of up to 120 neurons in the salamander retina as it responds to natural movies. Already in groups as small as 10 neurons, interactions between spikes can no longer be regarded as small perturbations in an otherwise independent system; for 40 or more neurons pairwise interactions need to be supplemented by a global interaction that controls the distribution of synchrony in the population. Here we show that such "K-pairwise" models--being systematic extensions of the previously used pairwise Ising models--provide an excellent account of the data. We explore the properties of the neural vocabulary by: 1) estimating its entropy, which constrains the population's capacity to represent visual information; 2) classifying activity patterns into a small set of metastable collective modes; 3) showing that the neural codeword ensembles are extremely inhomogenous; 4) demonstrating that the state of individual neurons is highly predictable from the rest of the population, allowing the capacity for error correction.},

abstract = {How the thermodynamic stability effects of protein mutations (DeltaDeltaG) are distributed is a fundamental property related to the architecture, tolerance to mutations (mutational robustness), and evolutionary history of proteins. The stability effects of mutations also dictate the rate and dynamics of protein evolution, with deleterious mutations being the main inhibitory factor. Using the FoldX algorithm that attempts to computationally predict DeltaDeltaG effects of mutations, we deduced the overall distributions of stability effects for all possible mutations in 21 different globular, single domain proteins. We found that these distributions are strikingly similar despite a range of sizes and folds, and largely follow a bi-Gaussian function: The surface residues exhibit a narrow distribution with a mildly destabilizing mean DeltaDeltaG ( approximately 0.6 kcal/mol), whereas the core residues exhibit a wider distribution with a stronger destabilizing mean ( approximately 1.4 kcal/mol). Since smaller proteins have a higher fraction of surface residues, the relative weight of these single distributions correlates with size. We also found that proteins evolved in the laboratory follow an essentially identical distribution, whereas de novo designed folds show markedly less destabilizing distributions (i.e. they seem more robust to the effects of mutations). This bi-Gaussian model provides an analytical description of the predicted distributions of mutational stability effects. It comprises a novel tool for analyzing proteins and protein models, for simulating the effect of mutations under evolutionary processes, and a quantitative description of mutational robustness.},

abstract = {A number of signals in the NMR spectrum of the B1 domain of staphylococcal protein G (GB1) show a chemical shift dependence on the concentration of the protein at pH 3 but not at neutral pH, implying the existence of self-association at low pH. NMR backbone relaxation experiments show that GB1 undergoes a slow conformational exchange at pH 3, which is not seen at higher pH. Analysis of relaxation dispersion experiments yields a self-association constant of 50 mM, and shows that (15)N chemical shift changes in the dimer interface are up to 3 ppm. The shift changes measured from concentration-dependent HSQC spectra and from relaxation dispersion show good consistency. Measurements of chemical shifts as a function of pH show that a hydrogen bond between the sidechains of Asp44 and Gln40 is broken when Asp44 is protonated, and that loss of this hydrogen bond leads to the breaking of the (i, i + 4) backbone helical hydrogen bond from Asp44 HN to Gln40 O, and therefore to a loss of two residues from the C-terminal end of the helix. This weakens the helix structure and facilitates the loss of further helical structure thus permitting dimerization, which is suggested to occur in the same way as observed for the A42F mutant of GB1 (Jee et al., Proteins 2007;71:1420-1431), by formation of an antiparallel beta-sheet between the edge strands 2 in two monomers. The monomer/dimer ratio is thus a finely balanced equilibrium even in the wild type protein.},

The evidence that these proteins exist without a well-defined folded structure in vitro is compelling, and justifies considering them a separate class within the protein world. In this paper, novel advances in the rapidly advancing field of IUPs are reviewed, with the major attention directed to the evidence of their unfolded character in vivo, the interplay of their residual structure and their various functional modes and the functional benefits their malleable structural state provides. Via all these details, it is demonstrated that in only a couple of years after its conception, the idea of protein disorder has already come of age and transformed our basic concepts of protein structure and function.},

Due to recent concerted activity, a critical transition in this field is gaining momentum, in which qualitative observations are turned into quantitative structural models of IDPs. Here, it is suggested that the transition is set up by the synergy of: (i) more advanced bioinformatic tools for the prediction of disorder and function of IDPs, (ii) ensemble description of their structure and dynamics in both free and bound states, down to the single molecule level, (iii) advent of in-cell approaches for characterizing their structure and function in vivo, and (iv) generation of small-molecule inhibitors both against their binding partners and IDPs themselves. In all, we suggest that due to steady advance in these areas, the field of 'unstructural' biology is rapidly maturing to a state where it can provide quantitative models of proteins functioning without well-defined three-dimensional structures.},

Recently, a second type of interaction has been suggested, mediated by short segments termed linear motifs, which are related to recognition elements of intrinsically disordered regions. Here, we propose a third kind of protein-protein recognition mechanism, mediated by disordered regions longer than 20-30 residues. Bioinformatics predictions and well-characterized examples, such as the kinase-inhibitory domain of Cdk inhibitors and the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-homology domain 2 of actin-binding proteins, show that these disordered regions conform to the definition of domains rather than motifs, i.e., they represent functional, evolutionary, and structural units. Their functions are distinct from those of short motifs and ordered domains, and establish a third kind of interaction principle. With these points, we argue that these long disordered regions should be recognized as a distinct class of biologically functional protein domains.},

abstract = {The thick filaments of vertebrate smooth muscle have a fundamentally different arrangement of myosin molecules from the bipolar, helical organization present in striated muscle filaments. This side-polar, non-helical structure is probably critical to the ability of smooth muscles to shorten by large amounts; however, details of myosin organization beyond this general description are unknown. The non-helical arrangement of myosin precludes the use of helical reconstruction methods for structural determination, and a tomographic approach is required. As a first step towards this goal we have determined the number of myosin molecules present at each 14.5 nm repeat in native smooth muscle myosin filaments by scanning transmission electron microscopy. The mass-per-length of myosin filaments was 159 kDa/nm, corresponding to 4.38(+/-0.11) (mean+/-s.e.m.) myosin molecules at each 14.5 nm level. The mass of thin filaments in the preparation (intrinsic control) was 21 kDa/nm, consistent with current models of smooth muscle thin filament structure, and the mass of tobacco mosaic virus (mass standard) was within 5\% of the known value. We conclude that native smooth muscle myosin filaments contain four myosin molecules at each 14.5 nm level, two on each side of the side-polar structure.},

abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) has recently emerged as a powerful technique to study conformational dynamics of biomolecules, but often its applicability is limited by the difficulty of separating the contributions of kinetics from those due to diffusion. We present a new approach based on the simultaneous analysis of the auto- and cross-correlation functions of the intensities measured in two independent detectors for a donor-acceptor labeled biomolecule. Fluctuations in fluorescence intensity are a consequence of diffusion and the variations in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency due to changes in donor-acceptor distance. Although the complete description of the correlation functions requires that diffusion is well-characterized, the ratio of any two correlation functions depends on kinetic parameters only. This provides a means by which kinetic information can be obtained independently of the diffusion contributions. As proof of principle, we reanalyze data obtained in previous work with nucleosomes. In contrast to our previous work, where a donor-only sample was used to characterize diffusion, we now show that the same kinetic information can be obtained from a single experiment with a double-labeled biomolecule. This eliminates not only the need of a reference, but also artifacts associated with changes in the observation volume between measurements.},

Coarse-grained representations combined with enhanced computer power currently allow the simulation of systems of biologically relevant size (submicrometric) and timescale (microsecond or millisecond). Although these techniques still cannot be considered as predictive as all-atom simulations, noticeable advances have recently been achieved, mainly concerning the use of more rigorous parameterization techniques and novel algorithms for sampling configurational space. Moreover, the simulation size scales and timescales coincide with those that can be reached with the most advanced spectroscopic techniques, making it possible to directly compare simulation and experiment.},

abstract = {The last decade has witnessed a renewed interest in the coarse-grained (CG) models for biopolymers, also stimulated by the needs of modern molecular biology, dealing with nano- to micro-sized bio-molecular systems and larger than microsecond timescale. This combination of size and timescale is, in fact, hard to access by atomic-based simulations. Coarse graining the system is a route to be followed to overcome these limits, but the ways of practically implementing it are many and different, making the landscape of CG models very vast and complex. In this paper, the CG models are reviewed and their features, applications and performances compared. This analysis, restricted to proteins, focuses on the minimalist models, namely those reducing at minimum the number of degrees of freedom without losing the possibility of explicitly describing the secondary structures. This class includes models using a single or a few interacting centers (beads) for each amino acid. From this analysis several issues emerge. The difficulty in building these models resides in the need for combining transferability/predictive power with the capability of accurately reproducing the structures. It is shown that these aspects could be optimized by accurately choosing the force field (FF) terms and functional forms, and combining different parameterization procedures. In addition, in spite of the variety of the minimalist models, regularities can be found in the parameters values and in FF terms. These are outlined and schematically presented with the aid of a generic phase diagram of the polypeptide in the parameter space and, hopefully, could serve as guidelines for the development of minimalist models incorporating the maximum possible level of predictive power and structural accuracy.},

abstract = {The activity within a living cell is based on a complex network of interactions among biomolecules, exchanging information and energy through biochemical processes. These events occur on different scales, from the nano- to the macroscale, spanning about 10 orders of magnitude in the space domain and 15 orders of magnitude in the time domain. Consequently, many different modeling techniques, each proper for a particular time or space scale, are commonly used. In addition, a single process often spans more than a single time or space scale. Thus, the necessity arises for combining the modeling techniques in multiscale approaches. In this Account, I first review the different modeling methods for bio-systems, from quantum mechanics to the coarse-grained and continuum-like descriptions, passing through the atomistic force field simulations. Special attention is devoted to their combination in different possible multiscale approaches and to the questions and problems related to their coherent matching in the space and time domains. These aspects are often considered secondary, but in fact, they have primary relevance when the aim is the coherent and complete description of bioprocesses. Subsequently, applications are illustrated by means of two paradigmatic examples: (i) the green fluorescent protein (GFP) family and (ii) the proteins involved in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication cycle. The GFPs are currently one of the most frequently used markers for monitoring protein trafficking within living cells; nanobiotechnology and cell biology strongly rely on their use in fluorescence microscopy techniques. A detailed knowledge of the actions of the virus-specific enzymes of HIV (specifically HIV protease and integrase) is necessary to study novel therapeutic strategies against this disease. Thus, the insight accumulated over years of intense study is an excellent framework for this Account. The foremost relevance of these two biomolecular systems was recently confirmed by the assignment of two of the Nobel prizes in 2008: in chemistry for the discovery of GFP and in medicine for the discovery of HIV. Accordingly, these proteins were studied with essentially all of the available modeling techniques, making them ideal examples for studying the details of multiscale approaches in protein modeling.},

This is used to derive a new density plot that contains the same information as the Ramachandran plot and can be used with the one(two) beads CG models.

abstract = {Since the early 1990s, DNA triplet repeat expansions have been found to be the cause in an ever increasing number of genetic neurologic diseases. A subset of this large family of genetic diseases has the expansion of a CAG DNA triplet in the open reading frame of a coding exon. The result of this DNA expansion is the expression of expanded glutamine amino acid repeat tracts in the affected proteins, leading to the term, Polyglutamine Diseases, which is applied to this sub-family of diseases. To date, nine distinct genes are known to be linked to polyglutamine diseases, including Huntington's disease, Machado-Joseph Disease and spinobulbar muscular atrophy or Kennedy's disease. Most of the polyglutamine diseases are characterized clinically as spinocerebellar ataxias. Here we discuss recent successes and advancements in polyglutamine disease research, comparing these different diseases with a common genetic flaw at the level of molecular biology and early drug design for a family of diseases where many new research tools for these genetic disorders have been developed. Polyglutamine disease research has successfully used interdisciplinary collaborative efforts, informative multiple mouse genetic models and advanced tools of pharmaceutical industry research to potentially serve as the prototype model of therapeutic research and development for rare neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {We explore the similarities and differences between the energy landscapes of proteins that have been selected by nature and those of some proteins designed by humans. Natural proteins have evolved to function as well as fold, and this is a source of energetic frustration. The sequence of Top7, on the other hand, was designed with architecture alone in mind using only native state stability as the optimization criterion. Its topology had not previously been observed in nature. Experimental studies show that the folding kinetics of Top7 is more complex than the kinetics of folding of otherwise comparable naturally occurring proteins. In this paper, we use structure prediction tools, frustration analysis, and free energy profiles to illustrate the folding landscapes of Top7 and two other proteins designed by Takada. We use both perfectly funneled (structure-based) and predictive (transferable) models to gain insight into the role of topological versus energetic frustration in these systems and show how they differ from those found for natural proteins. We also study how robust the folding of these designs would be to the simplification of the sequences using fewer amino acid types. Simplification using a five amino acid type code results in comparable quality of structure prediction to the full sequence in some cases, while the two-letter simplification scheme dramatically reduces the quality of structure prediction.},

@article{Tsai1999,
abstract = {Folding funnels have been the focus of considerable attention during the last few years. These have mostly been discussed in the general context of the theory of protein folding. Here we extend the utility of the concept of folding funnels, relating them to biological mechanisms and function. In particular, here we describe the shape of the funnels in light of protein synthesis and folding; flexibility, conformational diversity, and binding mechanisms; and the associated binding funnels, illustrating the multiple routes and the range of complexed conformers. Specifically, the walls of the folding funnels, their crevices, and bumps are related to the complexity of protein folding, and hence to sequential vs. nonsequential folding. Whereas the former is more frequently observed in eukaryotic proteins, where the rate of protein synthesis is slower, the latter is more frequent in prokaryotes, with faster translation rates. The bottoms of the funnels reflect the extent of the flexibility of the proteins. Rugged floors imply a range of conformational isomers, which may be close on the energy landscape. Rather than undergoing an induced fit binding mechanism, the conformational ensembles around the rugged bottoms argue that the conformers, which are most complementary to the ligand, will bind to it with the equilibrium shifting in their favor. Furthermore, depending on the extent of the ruggedness, or of the smoothness with only a few minima, we may infer nonspecific, broad range vs. specific binding. In particular, folding and binding are similar processes, with similar underlying principles. Hence, the shape of the folding funnel of the monomer enables making reasonable guesses regarding the shape of the corresponding binding funnel. Proteins having a broad range of binding, such as proteolytic enzymes or relatively nonspecific endonucleases, may be expected to have not only rugged floors in their folding funnels, but their binding funnels will also behave similarly, with a range of complexed conformations. Hence, knowledge of the shape of the folding funnels is biologically very useful. The converse also holds: If kinetic and thermodynamic data are available, hints regarding the role of the protein and its binding selectivity may be obtained. Thus, the utility of the concept of the funnel carries over to the origin of the protein and to its function.},

abstract = {Allostery has come of age; the number, breadth and functional roles of documented protein allostery cases are rising quickly. Since all dynamic proteins are potentially allosteric and allostery plays crucial roles in all cellular pathways, sorting and classifying allosteric mechanisms in proteins should be extremely useful in understanding and predicting how the signals are regulated and transmitted through the dynamic multi-molecular cellular organizations. Classification organizes the complex information thereby unraveling relationships and patterns in molecular activation and repression. In signaling, current classification schemes consider classes of molecules according to their functions; for example, epinephrine and norepinephrine secreted by the central nervous system are classified as neurotransmitters. Other schemes would account for epinephrine when secreted by the adrenal medulla to be hormone-like. Yet, such classifications account for the global function of the molecule; not for the molecular mechanism of how the signal transmission initiates and how it is transmitted. Here we provide a unified view of allostery and the first classification framework. We expect that a classification scheme would assist in comprehension of allosteric mechanisms, in prediction of signaling on the molecular level, in better comprehension of pathways and regulation of the complex signals, in translating them to the cascading events, and in allosteric drug design. We further provide a range of examples illustrating mechanisms in protein allostery and their classification from the cellular functional standpoint.},

It governs the organism's response to environmental and metabolic cues, dictating transient partner interactions in the cellular network. Textbooks taught us that allostery is a change of shape at one site on the protein surface brought about by ligand binding to another. For several years, it has been broadly accepted that the change of shape is not induced; rather, it is observed simply because a larger protein population presents it. Current data indicate that while side chains can reorient and rewire, allostery may not even involve a change of (backbone) shape. Assuming that the enthalpy change does not reverse the free-energy change due to the change in entropy, entropy is mainly responsible for binding.},

abstract = {The free energy landscape theory has transformed the field of protein folding. The significance of perceiving function in terms of conformational heterogeneity is gradually shifting the interest in the community from folding to function. From the free energy landscape standpoint the principles are unchanged: rather than considering the entire protein conformational landscape, the focus is on the ensemble around the bottom of the folding funnel. The protein can be viewed as populating one of two states: active or inactive. The basins of the two states are separated by a surmountable barrier, which allows the conformations to switch between the states. Unless the protein is a repressor, under physiological conditions it typically populates the inactive state. Ligand binding (or post-translational modification) triggers a switch to the active state. Constitutive allosteric mutations work by shifting the population from the inactive to the active state and keeping it there. This can happen by either destabilizing the inactive state, stabilizing the active state, or both. Identification of the mechanism through which they work is important since it may assist in drug discovery. Here we spotlight the usefulness of the free energy landscape in translational science, illustrating how oncogenic mutations can work in key proteins from the EGFR/Ras/Raf/Erk/Mek pathway, the main signaling pathway in cancer. Finally, we delineate the key components which are needed in order to trace the mechanism of allosteric events.},

Using a novel methodology for determining contacts, we can precisely follow hydrophobic aggregation as it proceeds through three stages: dispersed, transition, and collapsed. Theoretical modeling of the cluster formation observed by simulation indicates that this aggregation is cooperative and that the simulations favor the formation of a single cluster midway through the transition stage. This defines a minimum solute hydrophobic core volume. We compare this with protein hydrophobic core volumes determined from solved crystal structures. Our analysis shows that the solute core volume roughly estimates the minimum core size required for independent hydrophobic stabilization of a protein and defines a limiting concentration of nonpolar residues that can cause hydrophobic collapse. These results suggest that the physical forces driving aggregation of hydrophobic molecules in water is indeed responsible for protein folding.},

abstract = {Tandem repeat proteins, which are widespread in the human genome, tend to exhibit high stability and favorable expression, and hence, they are emerging as promising protein scaffolds in alternative to antibodies in biotechnology. In order to investigate the origin of the stability of these proteins, we dissect the subdomain architecture of the giant repeat protein PR65/A, which comprises 15 $\alpha$-helical HEAT repeats, using a series of truncations and deletions. We find that the N (HEAT 1-2) and the C (HEAT 14-15) subdomains are not capable of independent folding, but the addition of HEAT 13 to HEAT 14-15 results in an independently stable C-terminal subdomain (HEAT 13-15), which is in turn further stabilized by the inclusion of HEAT 12 (HEAT 12-15). We also further show that the stability of HEAT 13-15 is enhanced by its fusion to HEAT 1-2, and the artificial 5-HEAT-repeat protein thereby created (HEAT NC) behaves like a cooperative multidomain protein. We construct further variants, lacking one or both of the terminal subdomains, and find that such subdomains function as stabilizing caps within full-length PR65/A as in their absence, the central subdomain of the protein unfolds to form non-native $\beta$-sheet-like oligomers. Taken together, our results suggest that in full-length PR65/A, the more unstable regions within the central repeats are protected by the adjacent folded repeats, which thus act as gatekeepers by virtue of their greater stability.},

abstract = {Allostery, the process by which distant sites within a protein system are energetically coupled, is an efficient and ubiquitous mechanism for activity regulation. A purely mechanical view of allostery invoking only structural changes has developed over the decades as the classical view of the phenomenon. However, a fast growing list of examples illustrate the intimate link between internal motions over a wide range of time scales and function in protein-ligand interactions. Proteins respond to perturbations by redistributing their motions and they use fluctuating conformational states for binding and conformational entropy as a carrier of allosteric energy to modulate association with ligands. In several cases allosteric interactions proceed with minimal or no structural changes. We discuss emerging paradigms for the central role of protein dynamics in allostery.},

abstract = {The ability to inhibit binding or enzymatic activity is key to preventing aberrant behaviors of proteins. Allosteric inhibition is desirable as it offers several advantages over competitive inhibition, but the mechanisms of action remain poorly understood in most cases. Here we show that allosteric inhibition can be effected by destabilizing a low-populated conformational state that serves as an on-pathway intermediate for ligand binding, without altering the protein's ground-state structure. As standard structural approaches are typically concerned with changes in the ground-state structure of proteins, the presence of such a mechanism can go easily undetected. Our data strongly argue for the routine use of NMR tools suited to detect and characterize transiently formed conformational states in allosteric systems. Structure information on such important intermediates can ultimately result in more efficient design of allosteric inhibitors.},

abstract = {Allosteric regulation is used as a very efficient mechanism to control protein activity in most biological processes, including signal transduction, metabolism, catalysis and gene regulation. Allosteric proteins can exist in several conformational states with distinct binding or enzymatic activity. Effectors are considered to function in a purely structural manner by selectively stabilizing a specific conformational state, thereby regulating protein activity. Here we show that allosteric proteins can be regulated predominantly by changes in their structural dynamics. We have used NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize cyclic AMP (cAMP) binding to the catabolite activator protein (CAP), a transcriptional activator that has been a prototype for understanding effector-mediated allosteric control of protein activity. cAMP switches CAP from the 'off' state (inactive), which binds DNA weakly and non-specifically, to the 'on' state (active), which binds DNA strongly and specifically. In contrast, cAMP binding to a single CAP mutant, CAP-S62F, fails to elicit the active conformation; yet, cAMP binding to CAP-S62F strongly activates the protein for DNA binding. NMR and thermodynamic analyses show that despite the fact that CAP-S62F-cAMP(2) adopts the inactive conformation, its strong binding to DNA is driven by a large conformational entropy originating in enhanced protein motions induced by DNA binding. The results provide strong evidence that changes in protein motions may activate allosteric proteins that are otherwise structurally inactive.},

Recent studies on chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes and B-DNA reveal a reversal in the sign of the twist–stretch coupling at large strains. The similarity in the response in these two distinct supramolecular assemblies and at high strains suggests a fundamental, chirality-dependent nonlinear elastic behaviour. Here we seek the link between the microscopic origin of the nonlinearities and the effective twist–stretch coupling using energy-based theoretical frameworks and model simulations. Our analysis reveals a sensitive interplay between the deformation energetics and the sign of the coupling, highlighting robust design principles that determine both the sign and extent of these couplings. These design principles have already been exploited by nature to dynamically engineer such couplings, and have broad implications in mechanically coupled actuation, propulsion and transport in biology and technology.},

With adenosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate (p[NH]ppA) or with ADP and BeF(x) bound, this rise was very rapid (reciprocal time constant approx. 2000 s(-1)) and varied only slightly with starting temperature, suggesting that, with these ligands, two different protein conformations were present in rapid equilibrium over a large temperature range. In the presence of ATP, the transient included several relaxation processes. Overall, the results suggest that complexes of S1 with ATP or with a number of other ligands exist as a mixture of two forms in temperature-dependent equilibrium. The results throw light on the finding of different forms of S1 in recent crystallographic studies and indicate a surprising lack of strong coupling between myosin's structural state and the nature of the nucleotide bound.},

"This is the Freedom Ride of this era"

Fifty years ago, on May 4, 1961, the first bus of the Freedom Rides left Washington D.C. headed to New Orleans, with people committed to challenging segregation. The Freedom Rides were one of the sparks that contributed to a movement to dismantle a degrading system that violated human rights.

In an interview with organizers from The U.S. Boat to Gaza, Alice Walker, one of our nation's foremost contemporary writers and the first African-American woman to receive the Pulitzer Prize, likened the planned Freedom Flotilla II to Gaza to the Freedom Rides by saying  "this is the Freedom Ride of this era." In the U.S. the racist system of segregation was challenged; in South Africa the racist system of apartheid was challenged; in Palestine the racist system of occupation and apartheid, enforced by the Israeli government and supported by the U.S government, is being challenged and will come to an end.

The sixty people from the U.S. on THE AUDACITY OF HOPE - our boat from the U.S. - are sailing with the international Freedom Flotilla II to demand an end to the illegal Israeli naval blockade of Gaza. We are sailing to support the Palestinian struggle for freedom and justice.  

And throughout this country thousands more are building support for this effort and getting on board this massive campaign. Take a moment to view this short video of Alice Walker, and check ustogaza.org to learn more about what you can do today to help ensure the success of this mission.},

Results of this analysis showed that these proteins do not possess uniform structural properties, as expected for members of a single thermodynamic entity. Rather, these proteins may be divided into two structurally different groups: intrinsic coils, and premolten globules. Proteins from the first group have hydrodynamic dimensions typical of random coils in poor solvent and do not possess any (or almost any) ordered secondary structure. Proteins from the second group are essentially more compact, exhibiting some amount of residual secondary structure, although they are still less dense than native or molten globule proteins. An important feature of the intrinsically unstructured proteins is that they undergo disorder-order transition during or prior to their biological function. In this respect, the Protein Quartet model, with function arising from four specific conformations (ordered forms, molten globules, premolten globules, and random coils) and transitions between any two of the states, is discussed.},

abstract = {This review describes the family of intrinsically disordered proteins, members of which fail to form rigid 3-D structures under physiological conditions, either along their entire lengths or only in localized regions. Instead, these intriguing proteins/regions exist as dynamic ensembles within which atom positions and backbone Ramachandran angles exhibit extreme temporal fluctuations without specific equilibrium values. Many of these intrinsically disordered proteins are known to carry out important biological functions which, in fact, depend on the absence of a specific 3-D structure. The existence of such proteins does not fit the prevailing structure-function paradigm, which states that a unique 3-D structure is a prerequisite to function. Thus, the protein structure-function paradigm has to be expanded to include intrinsically disordered proteins and alternative relationships among protein sequence, structure, and function. This shift in the paradigm represents a major breakthrough for biochemistry, biophysics and molecular biology, as it opens new levels of understanding with regard to the complex life of proteins. This review will try to answer the following questions: how were intrinsically disordered proteins discovered? Why don't these proteins fold? What is so special about intrinsic disorder? What are the functional advantages of disordered proteins/regions? What is the functional repertoire of these proteins? What are the relationships between intrinsically disordered proteins and human diseases?},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) lack stable tertiary and/or secondary structures under physiological conditions in vitro. They are highly abundant in nature and their functional repertoire complements the functions of ordered proteins. IDPs are involved in regulation, signaling, and control, where binding to multiple partners and high-specificity/low-affinity interactions play a crucial role. Functions of IDPs are tuned via alternative splicing and posttranslational modifications. Intrinsic disorder is a unique structural feature that enables IDPs to participate in both one-to-many and many-to-one signaling. Numerous IDPs are associated with human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, amyloidoses, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes. Overall, intriguing interconnections among intrinsic disorder, cell signaling, and human diseases suggest that protein conformational diseases may result not only from protein misfolding, but also from misidentification, missignaling, and unnatural or nonnative folding. IDPs, such as alpha-synuclein, tau protein, p53, and BRCA1, are attractive targets for drugs modulating protein-protein interactions. From these and other examples, novel strategies for drug discovery based on IDPs have been developed. To summarize work in this area, we are introducing the D2 (disorder in disorders) concept.},

Thus motivated we have employed both experiment and simulation to characterize the end-to-end collision dynamics of unstructured, single-stranded DNAs ranging from 6 to 26 bases. We find that, because of the size and flexibility of the optical reporters employed experimentally, end-to-end collision dynamics exhibit little length dependence at length scales <11 bases. For longer constructs, however, the end-to-end collision rate exhibits a power-law relationship to polymer length with an exponent of -3.49 +/- 0.13. This represents a significantly stronger length dependence than observed experimentally for unstructured polypeptides or predicted by polymer scaling arguments. Simulations indicate, however, that the larger exponent stems from electrostatic effects that become important over the rather short length scale of these highly charged polymers. Finally, we have found that the end-to-end collision rate also depends linearly on solvent viscosity, with an experimentally significant, nonzero intercept (the extrapolated rate at zero viscosity) that is independent of chain length--n observation that sheds new light on the origins of the "internal friction" observed in the dynamics of many polymer systems.},

abstract = {Complex Markov models are widely used and powerful predictive tools to analyze stochastic biochemical processes. However, when the network of states is unknown, it is necessary to extract information from the data to partially build the network and estimate the values of the rates. The short-time behavior of the first-passage time distributions between two states in linear chains has been shown recently to behave as a power of time with an exponent equal to the number of intermediate states. For a general Markov model we derive the complete Taylor expansion of the first-passage time distribution between two arbitrary states. By combining algebraic methods and graph theory approaches it is shown that the first term of the Taylor expansion is determined by the shortest path from the initial state to the final state. When this path is unique, we prove that the coefficient of the first term can be written in terms of the product of the transition rates along the path. It is argued that the application of our results to first-return times may be used to estimate the dependence of rates on external parameters in experimentally measured time distributions.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional structure of proteins is determined by their linear amino acid sequences but decipherment of the underlying protein folding code has remained elusive. Recent studies have suggested that burials, as expressed by atomic distances to the molecular center, are sufficiently informative for structural determination while potentially obtainable from sequences. Here we provide direct evidence for this distinctive role of burials in the folding code, demonstrating that burial propensities estimated from local sequence can indeed be used to fold globular proteins in ab initio simulations. We have used a statistical scheme based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to classify all heavy atoms of a protein into a small number of burial atomic types depending on sequence context. Molecular dynamics simulations were then performed with a potential that forces all atoms of each type towards their predicted burial level, while simple geometric constraints were imposed on covalent structure and hydrogen bond formation. The correct folded conformation was obtained and distinguished in simulations that started from extended chains for a selection of structures comprising all three folding classes and high burial prediction quality. These results demonstrate that atomic burials can act as informational intermediates between sequence and structure, providing a new conceptual framework for improving structural prediction and understanding the fundamentals of protein folding.},

abstract = {This article describes the software suite GROMACS (Groningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) that was developed at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, in the early 1990s. The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License. It is maintained by a group of developers from the Universities of Groningen, Uppsala, and Stockholm, and the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz.

abstract = {We have crystallised three mutants of the barnase-barstar complex in which interactions across the interface have been deleted by simultaneous mutation of both residues involved in the interaction. Each mutant deletes a different type of interaction at the interface: the first complex bnHis102-->Ala-bsTyr29-->Phe (bn, barnase; bs, barstar), deletes a van der Waals packing interaction; the second complex, bnLys27-->Ala-bsThr42-->Ala, deletes a hydrogen bond; the third, bnLys27-->Ala-bsAsp35-->Ala, deletes a long-range charge-charge interaction. The contribution of each of these side-chains to the stability of the complex is known; the coupling energy between the deleted side-chains is also known. Despite each of the double mutants being significantly destabilised compared with the wild-type, the effects of mutation are local. Only small movements in the main-chain surrounding the sites of mutation and some larger movements of neighbouring side-chains are observed in the mutant complexes. The exact response to mutation is context-dependent and for the same mutant can vary depending upon the environment within the crystal. In some double mutant complexes, interfacial pockets, which are accessible to bulk solvent are formed, whereas interfacial cavities which are isolated from bulk solvent, are formed in others. In all double mutants, water molecules fill the created pockets and cavities. These water molecules mimic the deleted side-chains by occupying positions close to the non-carbon atoms of truncated side-chains and re-making many hydrogen bonds made by the truncated side-chains in the wild-type. It remains extremely difficult, however, to correlate energetic and structural responses to mutation because of unknown changes in entropy and entropy-enthalpy compensation.},

abstract = {Two methods were proposed recently to derive energy parameters from known native protein conformations and corresponding sets of decoys. One is based on finding, by means of a perceptron learning scheme, energy parameters such that the native conformations have lower energies than the decoys. The second method maximizes the difference between the native energy and the average energy of the decoys, measured in terms of the width of the decoys' energy distribution (Z-score). Whereas the perceptron method is sensitive mainly to "outlier" (i.e., extremal) decoys, the Z-score optimization is governed by the high density regions in decoy-space. We compare the two methods by deriving contact energies for two very different sets of decoys: the first obtained for model lattice proteins and the second by threading. We find that the potentials derived by the two methods are of similar quality and fairly closely related. This finding indicates that standard, naturally occurring sets of decoys are distributed in a way that yields robust energy parameters (that are quite insensitive to the particular method used to derive them). The main practical implication of this finding is that it is not necessary to fine-tune the potential search method to the particular set of decoys used.},

abstract = {Determining how a protein folds is a central problem in structural biology. The rate of folding of many proteins is determined by the transition state, so that a knowledge of its structure is essential for understanding the protein folding reaction. Here we use mutation measurements--which determine the role of individual residues in stabilizing the transition state--as restraints in a Monte Carlo sampling procedure to determine the ensemble of structures that make up the transition state. We apply this approach to the experimental data for the 98-residue protein acylphosphatase, and obtain a transition-state ensemble with the native-state topology and an average root-mean-square deviation of 6 A from the native structure. Although about 20 residues with small positional fluctuations form the structural core of this transition state, the native-like contact network of only three of these residues is sufficient to determine the overall fold of the protein. This result reveals how a nucleation mechanism involving a small number of key residues can lead to folding of a polypeptide chain to its unique native-state structure.},

abstract = {The description of protein folding at the proteome level requires further principles in addition to those that govern this phenomenon for individual molecules. An important aspect of the increased complexity of the folding process in the cellular environment is that proteins tend to be metastable against aggregation, as they are often expressed at levels at which they are poorly soluble. The maintenance of the solubility of the proteome requires the coordinated intervention of a range of quality control mechanisms, which include molecular chaperones, trafficking and degradation pathways, post-translational modifications and transcriptional and translational control. As these regulatory mechanisms should always be active to keep proteins in their soluble state, their impairment upon ageing or environmental stress can lead to the disruption of protein homeostasis resulting in uncontrolled widespread aggregation and disease.},

Kinetic analysis of the variants with stability similar to that of the wild type protein shows accelerated unfolding and refolding rates compatible with a preferential stabilization of the transition state. This is most likely caused by conformational strain in the native state, as deletion of a methyl group (Ile-->Val) leads to deceleration in unfolding and increased stability (up to 2 kcal x mol(-1)). Several of these Ile-->Val mutants have negative phi(-U) values, indicating that some noncanonical phi(-U) values might result from conformational strain. Thus, producing a stable protein does not necessarily mean that the design process has been entirely successful. Strained interactions could have been introduced, and a reduction in the buried volume could result in a large increase in stability and a reduction in unfolding rates.},

abstract = {Here we present a method for determining the inference of non-native conformations in the folding of a small domain, alpha-spectrin Src homology 3 domain. This method relies on the preservation of all native interactions after Tyr/Phe exchanges in solvent-exposed, contact-free positions. Minor changes in solvent exposure and free energy of the denatured ensemble are in agreement with the reverse hydrophobic effect, as the Tyr/Phe mutations slightly change the polypeptide hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. Interestingly, more important Gibbs energy variations are observed in the transition state ensemble (TSE). Considering the small changes induced by the H/OH replacements, the observed energy variations in the TSE are rather notable, but of a magnitude that would remain undetected under regular mutations that alter the folded structure free energy. Hydrophobic residues outside of the folding nucleus contribute to the stability of the TSE in an unspecific nonlinear manner, producing a significant acceleration of both unfolding and refolding rates, with little effect on stability. These results suggest that sectors of the protein transiently reside in non-native areas of the landscape during folding, with implications in the reading of phi values from protein engineering experiments. Contrary to previous proposals, the principle that emerges is that non-native contacts, or conformations, could be beneficial in evolution and design of some fast folding proteins.},

abstract = {The a subunit, a membrane protein from the E. coli F1F0 ATP synthase has been examined by Fourier analysis of hydrophobicity and of amino-acid residue variation. The amino-acid sequences of homologous subunits from Vibrio alginolyticus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus nidulans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Candida parapsilosis were used in the variability analysis. By Fourier analysis of sequence variation, two transmembrane helices are predicted to have one face in contact with membrane lipids, while the other spans are predicted to be more shielded from the lipids by protein. By Fourier analysis of hydrophobicity, six amphipathic alpha-helical segments are predicted in extra-membrane regions, including the region from Glu-196 to Asn-214. Fourier analysis of sequence variation in the b- and the c-subunits of the Escherichia coli F1F0 ATP synthase indicates that the single transmembrane span of the b-subunit and the C-terminal span of the c subunit each have a face in contact with membrane lipids. On the basis of this analysis topographical models for the a- and c-subunits and for the F0 complex are proposed.},

abstract = {Neat liquid phosphoric acid (H(3)PO(4)) has the highest intrinsic proton conductivity of any known substance and is a useful model for understanding proton transport in other phosphate-based systems in biology and clean energy technologies. Here, we present an ab initio molecular dynamics study that reveals, for the first time, the microscopic mechanism of this high proton conductivity. Anomalously fast proton transport in hydrogen-bonded systems involves a structural diffusion mechanism in which intramolecular proton transfer is driven by specific hydrogen bond rearrangements in the surrounding environment. Aqueous media transport excess charge defects through local hydrogen bond rearrangements that drive individual proton transfer reactions. In contrast, strong, polarizable hydrogen bonds in phosphoric acid produce coupled proton motion and a pronounced protic dielectric response of the medium, leading to the formation of extended, polarized hydrogen-bonded chains. The interplay between these chains and a frustrated hydrogen-bond network gives rise to the high proton conductivity.},

abstract = {Polyglutamine aggregation is associated with neurodegeneration in nine different disorders. The effects of polyglutamine length and peptide concentration on the kinetics of aggregation were previously analyzed using a homogeneous nucleation model that assumes the presence of a single bottleneck along the free energy profile G(n), where n denotes the number of polyglutamine molecules. The observation of stable, soluble oligomers as intermediates along aggregation pathways is refractory to the assumptions of homogeneous nucleation. Furthermore, the analysis of in vitro kinetic data using a specific variant of homogeneous nucleation leads to confounding observations such as fractional and/or negative values for estimates of the critical nucleus size. Here, we show that the homogeneous nucleation model is inherently robust and is unlikely to yield fractional values if the underlying process is strictly homogeneous with a free energy profile G(n) that displays a sharp maximum at n=n*, where n* corresponds to the critical nucleus. Conversely, a model that includes oligomers of different size and different potentials for supporting turnover into fibrils yields estimates of fractional and/or negative nucleus sizes when the kinetic data are analyzed using the assumption of a homogeneous process. This model provides a route to reconcile independent observations of heterogeneous distributions of oligomers and other non-fibrillar aggregates with results obtained from analysis of aggregation kinetics using the assumption of a homogeneous nucleation model. In the new model, the mechanisms of fibril assembly are governed by the relative stabilities of two types of oligomers viz., fibril-competent and fibril-incompetent oligomers, the size of the smallest fibril competent oligomer, and rates for conformational conversion within different oligomers.},

abstract = {As the resolution of experiments to measure folding kinetics continues to improve, it has become imperative to avoid bias that may come with fitting data to a predetermined mechanistic model. Toward this end, we present a rate spectrum approach to analyze timescales present in kinetic data. Computing rate spectra of noisy time series data via numerical discrete inverse Laplace transform is an ill-conditioned inverse problem, so a regularization procedure must be used to perform the calculation. Here, we show the results of different regularization procedures applied to noisy multiexponential and stretched exponential time series, as well as data from time-resolved folding kinetics experiments. In each case, the rate spectrum method recapitulates the relevant distribution of timescales present in the data, with different priors on the rate amplitudes naturally corresponding to common biases toward simple phenomenological models. These results suggest an attractive alternative to the "Occam's razor" philosophy of simply choosing models with the fewest number of relaxation rates.

abstract = {A transparent coating that repels a wide variety of liquids, prevents staining, is capable of self-repair and is robust towards mechanical damage can have a broad technological impact, from solar cell coatings to self-cleaning optical devices. Here we employ colloidal templating to design transparent, nanoporous surface structures. A lubricant can be firmly locked into the structures and, owing to its fluidic nature, forms a defect-free, self-healing interface that eliminates the pinning of a second liquid applied to its surface, leading to efficient liquid repellency, prevention of adsorption of liquid-borne contaminants, and reduction of ice adhesion strength. We further show how this method can be applied to locally pattern the repellent character of the substrate, thus opening opportunities to spatially confine any simple or complex fluids. The coating is highly defect-tolerant due to its interconnected, honeycomb wall structure, and repellency prevails after the application of strong shear forces and mechanical damage. The regularity of the coating allows us to understand and predict the stability or failure of repellency as a function of lubricant layer thickness and defect distribution based on a simple geometric model.},

abstract = {The precise regulation of protein activity is fundamental to life. The allosteric control of an active site by a remote regulatory binding site is a mechanism of regulation found across protein classes, from enzymes to motors to signaling proteins. We describe a general approach for manipulating allosteric control using synthetic optical switches. Our strategy is exemplified by a ligand-gated ion channel of central importance in neuroscience, the ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR). Using structure-based design, we have modified its ubiquitous clamshell-type ligand-binding domain to develop a light-activated channel, which we call LiGluR. An agonist is covalently tethered to the protein through an azobenzene moiety, which functions as the optical switch. The agonist is reversibly presented to the binding site upon photoisomerization, initiating clamshell domain closure and concomitant channel gating. Photoswitching occurs on a millisecond timescale, with channel conductances that reflect the photostationary state of the azobenzene at a given wavelength. Our device has potential uses not only in biology but also in bioelectronics and nanotechnology.},

abstract = {As a bacterial blue light sensor the photoactive yellow protein (PYP) undergoes conformational changes upon signal transduction. The absorption of a photon triggers a series of events that are initially localized around the protein chromophore, extends to encompass the whole protein within microseconds, and leads to the formation of the transient pB signaling state. We study the formation of this signaling state pB by molecular simulation and predict its solution structure. Conventional straightforward molecular dynamics is not able to address this formation process due to the long (microsecond) timescales involved, which are (partially) caused by the presence of free energy barriers between the metastable states. To overcome these barriers, we employed the parallel tempering (or replica exchange) method, thus enabling us to predict qualitatively the formation of the PYP signaling state pB. In contrast to the receptor state pG of PYP, the characteristics of this predicted pB structure include a wide open chromophore-binding pocket, with the chromophore and Glu(46) fully solvent-exposed. In addition, loss of alpha-helical structure occurs, caused by the opening motion of the chromophore-binding pocket and the disruptive interaction of the negatively charged Glu(46) with the backbone atoms in the hydrophobic core of the N-terminal cap. Recent NMR experiments agree very well with these predictions.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of large-scale conformational changes in proteins still poses a challenge for molecular simulations. We employ transition path sampling of explicit solvent molecular dynamics trajectories to obtain atomistic insight in the reaction network of the millisecond timescale partial unfolding transition in the photocycle of the bacterial sensor photoactive yellow protein. Likelihood maximization analysis predicts the best model for the reaction coordinates of each substep as well as tentative transition states, without further simulation. We find that the unfolding of the alpha-helical region 43-51 is followed by sequential solvent exposure of both Glu46 and the chromophore. Which of these two residues is exposed first is correlated with the presence of a salt bridge that is part of the N-terminal domain. Additional molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the exposure of the chromophore does not result in a productive pathway. We discuss several possibilities for experimental validation of these predictions. Our results open the way for studying millisecond conformational changes in other medium-sized (signaling) proteins.},

From the water occupancy statistics, we directly obtained the free energy of filling, and from its temperature dependence the entropy of filling. We found a negative entropy of about -1.3 k(B) per molecule for filling the nanotube with a hydrogen-bonded single-file chain of water molecules. The entropy of filling is nearly independent of the strength of the attractive carbon-water interactions over the range studied. In contrast, the energy of transfer depends strongly on the carbon-water attraction strength. These results are in good agreement with entropies of about -0.5 k(B) per water molecule obtained from grand-canonical Monte Carlo calculations of water in quasi-infinite tubes in vacuum under periodic boundary conditions. Overall, for realistic carbon-water interactions we expect that at ambient conditions filling of a (6,6) carbon nanotube open to a water reservoir is driven by a favorable decrease in energy, and opposed by a small loss of water entropy.},

We show how simple arguments lead to theories of the rate of such events much like the absolute rate theory of chemical reactions corrected by a transmission factor. Both the probability of the rare cellular states that allow epigenetic escape and the transmission factor depend on the rates of DNA binding and unbinding events and on the rates of protein synthesis and degradation. Different mechanisms of escape from the stable attractors occur in the nonadiabatic, weakly adiabatic, and strictly adiabatic regimes, characterized by the relative values of those input rates.},

The protein and DNA state dynamics are treated stochastically and on an equal footing. In this approach the mean influence of the proteomic cloud created by one gene on the action of another is self-consistently computed. Within this approximation a broad range of stochastic genetic switches may be solved exactly in terms of finding the probability distribution and its moments. A much larger class of problems, such as genetic networks and cascades, also remain exactly solvable with this approximation. We discuss, in depth, certain specific types of basic switches used by biological systems and compare their behavior to the expectation for a deterministic switch.},

abstract = {We show how to construct a reduced description of interacting genes in noisy, small regulatory networks using coupled binary spin variables. Treating both the protein number and gene expression state variables stochastically and on equal footing, we propose a mapping that connects the molecular level description of networks to the binary representation. We construct a phase diagram indicating when genes can be considered to be independent and when the coupling between them cannot be neglected, which can lead to synchrony or correlations. We find that an appropriately mapped Boolean description reproduces the probabilities of gene expression states of the full stochastic system very well, and can be transferred to examples of self-regulatory systems with a larger number of gene copies.},

abstract = {We employ the inverse Boltzmann method to coarse-grain three commonly used three-site water models (TIP3P, SPC and SPC/E) where one molecule is replaced with one coarse-grained particle with isotropic two-body interactions only. The shape of the coarse-grained potentials is dominated by the ratio of two lengths, which can be rationalized by the geometric constraints of the water clusters. It is shown that for simple two-body potentials either the radial distribution function or the geometrical packing can be optimized. In a similar way, as needed for multiscale methods, either the pressure or the compressibility can be fitted to the all atom liquid. In total, a speed-up by a factor of about 50 in computational time can be reached by this coarse-graining procedure.},

abstract = {Microtubule associated protein tau is a phosphoprotein which potentially has 80 serine/threonine and 5 tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Normal brain tau contains 2-3 moles of phosphate per mole of the protein. In Alzheimer's disease brain, tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated to a stoichiometry of at least three-fold greater than normal tau, and in this altered state it is aggregated into paired helical filaments forming neurofibrillary tangles, a histopathological hallmark of the disease. The abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau is also a hallmark of several other related neurodegenerative disorders, called tauopathies. The density of neurofibrillary tangles in the neocortex correlates with dementia and, hence, is a rational therapeutic target and an area of increasing research interest. Development of rational tau-based therapeutic drugs requires understanding of the role of various phosphorylation sites, protein kinases and phosphatases, and post-translational modifications that regulate the phosphorylation of this protein at various sites, as well as the molecular mechanism by which the abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau leads to neurodegeneration and dementia. In this article we briefly review the progress made in these areas of research.},

abstract = {Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), a crucial cellular antioxidant, can in certain settings mediate toxic chemistry through its Cu cofactor. Whether this latter property explains why mutations in SOD1 cause FALS has been debated. Here, we demonstrate motor neuron disease in transgenic mice expressing a SOD1 variant that mutates the four histidine residues that coordinately bind Cu. In-depth analyses of this new mouse model, previously characterized models and FALS human tissues revealed that the accumulation of detergent-insoluble forms of SOD1 is a common feature of the disease. These insoluble species include full-length SOD1 proteins, peptide fragments, stable oligomers and ubiquitinated entities. Moreover, chaperones Hsp25 and alphaB-crystallin specifically co-fractionated with insoluble SOD1. In cultured cells, all 11 of the FALS variants tested produced insoluble forms of mutant SOD1. Importantly, expression of recombinant peptide fragments of wild-type SOD1 in cultured cells also produced insoluble species, suggesting that SOD1 possesses elements with an intrinsic propensity to aggregate. Thus, modifications to the protein, such as FALS mutations, fragmentation and possibly covalent modification, may simply act to augment a natural, but potentially toxic, propensity to aggregate.},

We study a model of cytoskeletal structure treating it as an amorphous network of hard centers rigidly cross-linked by nonlinear elastic strings, neglecting the effects of motorization. Using simulations along with a self-consistent phonon method, we show that this minimal model exhibits diverse thermodynamically stable mechanical phases that depend on excluded volume, cross-link concentration, filament length, and stiffness. Within the framework set by the free energy functional formulation and making use of the random first order transition theory of structural glasses, we further estimate the characteristic densities for a kinetic glass transition to occur in this model system. Network connectivity strongly modulates the transition boundaries between various equilibrium phases, as well as the kinetic glass transition density.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibers are filamentous protein structures commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Unlike disease-associated amyloids, which are the products of protein misfolding, Escherichia coli assemble membrane-anchored functional amyloid fibers called curli. Curli fibers are composed of two proteins, CsgA and CsgB. In vivo, the polymerization of the major curli subunit protein, CsgA, is dependent on CsgB-mediated nucleation. The amyloid core of CsgA features five imperfect repeats (R1-R5), and R1 and R5 govern CsgA responsiveness to CsgB nucleation and self-seeding by CsgA fibers. Here, the specificity of bacterial amyloid nucleation was probed, revealing that certain aspartic acid and glycine residues inhibit the intrinsic aggregation propensities and nucleation responsiveness of R2, R3, and R4. These residues function as "gatekeepers" to modulate CsgA polymerization efficiency and potential toxicity. A CsgA molecule lacking gatekeeper residues polymerized in vitro significantly faster than wild-type CsgA and polymerized in vivo in the absence of the nucleation machinery, resulting in mislocalized fibers. This uncontrolled polymerization was associated with cytotoxicity, suggesting that incorrectly regulated CsgA polymerization was detrimental to the cell.},

abstract = {An increasing number of biological machines have been revealed to have more than two macroscopic states. Quantifying the underlying multiple-basin functional landscape is essential for understanding their functions. However, the present models seem to be insufficient to describe such multiple-state systems. To meet this challenge, we have developed a coarse grained triple-basin structure-based model with implicit ligand. Based on our model, the constructed functional landscape is sufficiently sampled by the brute-force molecular dynamics simulation. We explored maltose-binding protein (MBP) which undergoes large-scale domain motion between open, apo-closed (partially closed) and holo-closed (fully closed) states responding to ligand binding. We revealed an underlying mechanism whereby major induced fit and minor population shift pathways co-exist by quantitative flux analysis. We found that the hinge regions play an important role in the functional dynamics as well as that increases in its flexibility promote population shifts. This finding provides a theoretical explanation of the mechanistic discrepancies in PBP protein family. We also found a functional "backtracking" behavior that favors conformational change. We further explored the underlying folding landscape in response to ligand binding. Consistent with earlier experimental findings, the presence of ligand increases the cooperativity and stability of MBP. This work provides the first study to explore the folding dynamics and functional dynamics under the same theoretical framework using our triple-basin functional model.},

abstract = {Time-resolved single molecule fluorescence measurements may be used to probe the conformational dynamics of biological macromolecules. The best time resolution in such techniques will only be achieved by measuring the arrival times of individual photons at the detector. A general approach to the estimation of molecular parameters based on individual photon arrival times is presented. The amount of information present in a data set is quantified by the Fisher information, thereby providing a guide to deriving the basic equations relating measurement uncertainties and time resolution. Based on these information-theoretical considerations, a data analysis algorithm is presented that details the optimal analysis of single-molecule data. This method natively accounts and corrects for background photons and cross talk, and can scale to an arbitrary number of channels. By construction, and with corroboration from computer simulations, we show that this algorithm reaches the theoretical limit, extracting the maximal information out of the data. The bias inherent in the algorithm is considered and its implications for experimental design are discussed. The ideas underlying this approach are general and are expected to be applicable to any information-limited measurement.},

abstract = {Precise measurement of the potential of mean force is necessary for a fundamental understanding of the dynamics and chemical reactivity of a biological macromolecule. The unique advantage provided by the recently developed constant-information approach to analyzing time-dependent single-molecule fluorescence measurements was used with maximum entropy deconvolution to create a procedure for the accurate determination of molecular conformational distributions, and analytical expressions for the errors in these distributions were derived. This new method was applied to a derivatized poly(L-proline) series, P(n)CG3K(biotin) (n = 8, 12, 15, 18, and 24), using a modular, server-based single-molecule spectrometer that is capable of registering photon arrival times with a continuous-wave excitation source. To account for potential influence from the microscopic environment, factors that were calibrated and corrected molecule by molecule include background, cross-talk, and detection efficiency. For each single poly(L-proline) molecule, sharply peaked F\"{o}rster type resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency and distance distributions were recovered, indicating a static end-to-end distance on the time scale of measurement. The experimental distances were compared with models of varying rigidity. The results suggest that the 23 angstroms persistence length wormlike chain model derived from experiments with high molecular weight poly(L-proline) is applicable to short chains as well.},

Stopped-flow kinetics, circular dichroism, and NMR experiments reveal that there are at least three distinct phases in the folding of Top7, that a nonnative conformation is stable at equilibrium, and that multiple fragments of Top7 are stable in isolation. These results indicate that the folding of Top7 is significantly less cooperative than the folding of similarly sized naturally occurring proteins, suggesting that the cooperative folding and smooth free energy landscapes observed for small naturally occurring proteins are not general properties of polypeptide chains that fold to unique stable structures but are instead a product of natural selection.},

abstract = {Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity in protein-protein interaction is an outstanding challenge of postgenome biology. The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences of hundreds of bacterial genomes enables various statistical approaches to this problem. In this context covariance-based methods have been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly and indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted from use in statistical physics. Applied to a set of >2,500 representatives of the bacterial two-component signal transduction system, the combination of covariance with global inference successfully and robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions between sensor kinase (SK) and response regulator (RR) proteins and for homointeractions between RR proteins. The spectacular success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness of the global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only 1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on the mechanism of protein-protein interaction, and establish the foundation for the accurate prediction of interacting protein partners.},

abstract = {Phi values are experimental measures of the effects of mutations on the folding kinetics of a protein. A central question is what structural information Phi values give about the transition-state of folding. Traditionally, a Phi value is interpreted as representing the "nativeness" of a mutated residue in the transition-state. However, this interpretation is often problematic. We present here a better structural interpretation of Phi values for mutations within a given helix. Our interpretation is based on a simple physical model that distinguishes between secondary and tertiary free energy contributions of helical residues. From a linear fit of the model to experimental data, we obtain two structural parameters: the extent of helix formation in the transition-state, and the nativeness of tertiary interactions in the transition-state. We apply the model to all proteins with well-characterized helices for which more than 10 Phi values are available: protein A, CI2, and protein L. The model is simple to apply to experimental data, captures nonclassical Phi values <0 or >1 in these helices, and explains how different mutations at a given site can lead to different Phi values.},

abstract = {Allostery is a phenomenon that couples effector ligand binding at an allosteric site to a structural and/or dynamic change at a distant regulated site. To study an allosteric transition, we vary the size of the allosteric site and its interactions to construct a series of energy landscapes with pronounced minima corresponding to both the effector bound and unbound crystal structures. We use molecular dynamics to sample these landscapes. The degree of perturbation by the effector, modeled by the size of the allosteric site, provides an order parameter for allostery that allows us to determine how microscopic motions give rise to commonly discussed macroscopic mechanisms: (i) induced fit, (ii) population shift, and (iii) entropy driven. These mechanisms involve decreasing structural differences between the effector bound and unbound populations. A metric (ligand-induced cooperativity) can measure how cooperatively a given regulated site responds to effector binding and therefore what kind of allosteric mechanism is involved. We apply the model to three proteins with experimentally characterized transitions: (i) calmodulin-GFP Ca(2+) sensor protein, (ii) maltose binding protein, and (iii) CSL transcription factor. Remarkably, the model is able to reproduce allosteric motion and predict coupling in a manner consistent with experiment.},

No natural monomeric one-domain member of this protein superfamily is known. To determine the stability of the single domains and to explain the ubiquitous domain duplication, the isolated domains of protein S were constructed. The N-domain is thermodynamically more stable than the C-domain. In intact protein S, domain interactions lead to an apparent decrease in stability of the N-terminal domain, whereas the C-terminal domain is stabilised. In contrast, unfolding kinetics of both domains are decreased 100-fold due to interactions in the complete molecule.},

abstract = {Energy landscape theory is a powerful tool for understanding the structure and dynamics of complex molecular systems, in particular biological macromolecules. The primary sequence of a protein defines its free-energy landscape and thus determines the folding pathway and the rate constants of folding and unfolding, as well as the protein's native structure. Theory has shown that roughness in the energy landscape will lead to slower folding, but derivation of detailed experimental descriptions of this landscape is challenging. Simple folding models show that folding is significantly influenced by chain entropy; proteins in which the contacts are local fold quickly, owing to the low entropy cost of forming stabilizing, native contacts during folding. For some protein families, stability is also a determinant of folding rate constants. Where these simple metrics fail to predict folding behaviour, it is probable that there are features in the energy landscape that are unusual. Such general observations cannot explain the folding behaviour of the R15, R16 and R17 domains of alpha-spectrin. R15 folds approximately 3,000 times faster than its homologues, although they have similar structures, stabilities and, as far as can be determined, transition-state stabilities. Here we show that landscape roughness (internal friction) is responsible for the slower folding and unfolding of R16 and R17. We use chimaeric domains to demonstrate that this internal friction is a property of the core, and suggest that frustration in the landscape of the slow-folding spectrin domains may be due to misdocking of the long helices during folding. Theoretical studies have suggested that rugged landscapes will result in slower folding; here we show experimentally that such a phenomenon directly influences the folding kinetics of a 'normal' protein, that is, one with a significant energy barrier that folds on a relatively slow, millisecond-second, timescale.},

abstract = {The 15th, 16th, and 17th repeats of chicken brain alpha-spectrin (R15, R16, and R17, respectively) are very similar in terms of structure and stability. However, R15 folds and unfolds 3 orders of magnitude faster than R16 and R17. This is unexpected. The rate-limiting transition state for R15 folding is investigated using protein engineering methods (Phi-value analysis) and compared with previously completed analyses of R16 and R17. Characterisation of many mutants suggests that all three proteins have similar complexity in the folding landscape. The early rate-limiting transition states of the three domains are similar in terms of overall structure, but there are significant differences in the patterns of Phi-values. R15 apparently folds via a nucleation-condensation mechanism, which involves concomitant folding and packing of the A- and C-helices, establishing the correct topology. R16 and R17 fold via a more framework-like mechanism, which may impede the search to find the correct packing of the helices, providing a possible explanation for the fast folding of R15.},

abstract = {A recently introduced computational algorithm to extend time scales of atomically detailed simulations is illustrated. The algorithm, milestoning, is based on partitioning the dynamics to a sequence of trajectories between "milestones" and constructing a non-Markovian model for the motion along a reaction coordinate. The kinetics of a conformational transition in a blocked alanine is computed and shown to be accurate, more efficient than straightforward molecular dynamics by a factor of about 9, and nonexponential. A general scaling argument predicts a linear speedup with the number of milestones for diffusive processes and an exponential speedup for transitions over barriers. The algorithm is also trivial to parallelize. As a side result, milestoning also produces the free energy profile along the reaction coordinate and is able to describe nonequilibrium motions along one (or a few) degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {Recent experiments have demonstrated that proteins unfold when two atoms are mechanically pulled apart, and that this process is different to when heated or when a chemical denaturant is added to the solution. Experiments have also shown that the response of proteins to external forces is very diverse, some of them being "hard," and others "soft." Mechanical resistance originates from the presence of barriers on the energy landscape; together, experiment and simulation have demonstrated that unfolding occurs through alternative pathways when different pairs of atoms undergo mechanical extension. Here we use simulation to probe the mechanical resistance of six structurally diverse proteins when pulled in different directions. For this, we use two very different models: a detailed, transferable one, and a coarse-grained, structure-based one. The coarse-grained model gives results that are surprisingly similar to the detailed one and qualitatively agree with experiment; i.e., the mechanical resistance of different proteins or of a single protein pulled in different directions can be predicted by simulation. The results demonstrate the importance of pulling direction relative to the local topology in determining mechanical stability, and rationalize the effect of the location of importation/degradation tags on the rates of mitochondrial import or protein degradation in vivo.},

The prediction of three-dimensional structure from sequence requires a detailed understanding of these interactions. Progress toward this objective is summarized in this review by means of a thermodynamic framework for describing membrane protein folding and stability. The framework includes a coherent thermodynamic formalism for determining and describing the energetics of peptide-bilayer interactions and a review of the properties of the environment of membrane proteins--the bilayer milieu. Using a four-step thermodynamic cycle as a guide, advances in three main aspects of membrane protein folding energetics are discussed: protein binding and folding in bilayer interfaces, transmembrane helix insertion, and helix-helix interactions. The concepts of membrane protein stability that emerge provide insights to fundamental issues of protein folding.},

abstract = {The dynamic nature of biomolecules leads to significant challenges when characterizing the structural properties associated with function. While X-ray crystallography and imaging techniques (such as cryo-electron microscopy) can reveal the structural details of stable molecular complexes, strategies must be developed to characterize configurations that exhibit only marginal stability (such as intermediates) or configurations that do not correspond to minima on the energy landscape (such as transition-state ensembles). Here, we present a methodology (MDfit) that utilizes molecular dynamics simulations to generate configurations of excited states that are consistent with available biophysical and biochemical measurements. To demonstrate the approach, we present a sequence of configurations that are suggested to be associated with transfer RNA (tRNA) movement through the ribosome (translocation). The models were constructed by combining information from X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and biochemical data. These models provide a structural framework for translocation that may be further investigated experimentally and theoretically to determine the precise energetic character of each configuration and the transition dynamics between them.},

abstract = {Large conformational changes in the LID and NMP domains of adenylate kinase (AKE) are known to be key to ligand binding and catalysis, yet the order of binding events and domain motion is not well understood. Combining the multiple available structures for AKE with the energy landscape theory for protein folding, a theoretical model was developed for allostery, order of binding events, and efficient catalysis. Coarse-grained models and nonlinear normal mode analysis were used to infer that intrinsic structural fluctuations dominate LID motion, whereas ligand-protein interactions and cracking (local unfolding) are more important during NMP motion. In addition, LID-NMP domain interactions are indispensable for efficient catalysis. LID domain motion precedes NMP domain motion, during both opening and closing. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed 1:1:1 correspondence between LID domain closure, NMP domain closure, and substrate turnover. This catalytic cycle has likely evolved to reduce misligation, and thus inhibition, of AKE. The separation of allosteric motion into intrinsic structural fluctuations and ligand-induced contributions can be generalized to further our understanding of allosteric transitions in other proteins.},

Thus, structure-based models with atomic details included can be used to bridge our understanding between these two approaches. We report on the robustness of folding mechanisms in one such all-atom model. Results for the B domain of Protein A, the SH3 domain of C-Src Kinase, and Chymotrypsin Inhibitor 2 are reported. The interplay between side chain packing and backbone folding is explored. We also compare this model to a C(alpha) structure-based model and an all-atom empirical forcefield. Key findings include: (1) backbone collapse is accompanied by partial side chain packing in a cooperative transition and residual side chain packing occurs gradually with decreasing temperature, (2) folding mechanisms are robust to variations of the energetic parameters, (3) protein folding free-energy barriers can be manipulated through parametric modifications, (4) the global folding mechanisms in a C(alpha) model and the all-atom model agree, although differences can be attributed to energetic heterogeneity in the all-atom model, and (5) proline residues have significant effects on folding mechanisms, independent of isomerization effects. Because this structure-based model has atomic resolution, this work lays the foundation for future studies to probe the contributions of specific energetic factors on protein folding and function.},

abstract = {While the energy landscape theory of protein folding is now a widely accepted view for understanding how relatively weak molecular interactions lead to rapid and cooperative protein folding, such a framework must be extended to describe the large-scale functional motions observed in molecular machines. In this review, we discuss (1) the development of the energy landscape theory of biomolecular folding, (2) recent advances toward establishing a consistent understanding of folding and function and (3) emerging themes in the functional motions of enzymes, biomolecular motors and other biomolecular machines. Recent theoretical, computational and experimental lines of investigation have provided a very dynamic picture of biomolecular motion. In contrast to earlier ideas, where molecular machines were thought to function similarly to macroscopic machines, with rigid components that move along a few degrees of freedom in a deterministic fashion, biomolecular complexes are only marginally stable. Since the stabilizing contribution of each atomic interaction is on the order of the thermal fluctuations in solution, the rigid body description of molecular function must be revisited. An emerging theme is that functional motions encompass order-disorder transitions and structural flexibility provides significant contributions to the free energy. In this review, we describe the biological importance of order-disorder transitions and discuss the statistical-mechanical foundation of theoretical approaches that can characterize such transitions.},

abstract = {Riboswitches are noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in response to changing concentrations of specific metabolites. Switching activity is affected by the interplay between the aptamer domain and expression platform of the riboswitch. The aptamer domain binds the metabolite, locking the riboswitch in a ligand-bound conformation. In absence of the metabolite, the expression platform forms an alternative secondary structure by sequestering the 3' end of a nonlocal helix called P1. We use all-atom structure-based simulations to characterize the folding, unfolding, and metabolite binding of the aptamer domain of the S-adenosylmethionine-1 (SAM-1) riboswitch. Our results suggest that folding of the nonlocal helix (P1) is rate-limiting in aptamer domain formation. Interestingly, SAM assists folding of the P1 helix by reducing the associated free energy barrier. Because the 3' end of the P1 helix is sequestered by an alternative helix in the absence of metabolites, this observed ligand-control of P1 formation provides a mechanistic explanation of expression platform regulation.},

abstract = {Are the most dynamically flexible regions around the equilibrium structure of an enzyme the same regions involved in the transition state for rate limiting processes involved in the enzymatic reaction? Kern and-coworkers (Wolf-Watzet al., 2004; Henzler-Wildman et al., 2007a, 2007b) have shown that insights about functionally relevant motions that determine the overall enzyme turnover rate can be obtained by investigating conformational dynamics around the equilibrium basin of the enzyme adenylate kinase. An allosteric change in protein structure turns out to be the controlling process. In this commentary we compare results of this study with earlier predictions of the route by which the enzyme undergoes its conformational change. These predictions are based on the idea that the energy surface for the protein is determined by the end structures of the conformational change. A key issue is whether the protein moves by specific hinges or whether it "cracks" and accesses partially unfolded states during its structural change.},

The comparison of H3G3/H3G6 and L53AI54A/YY suggests that Tyr55 and/or Tyr56 interact with the three-helix core, leading other residues in this region of the protein to dock with the core as folding progresses.

We report the observation of the fast kinetics (nanosecond to millisecond) of helix melting in a small 21-residue alanine-based peptide. The unfolding reaction is initiated using a laser-induced temperature jump and probed using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy. The model peptide exhibits fast unfolding kinetics with a time constant of 160 +/- 60 ns at 28 degrees C in response to a laser-induced temperature jump of 18 degrees C which is completed within 20 ns. Using the unfolding time and the measured helix-coil equilibrium constant of the model peptide, a folding rate constant of approximately 6 x 10(7) s-1 (t1/2 = 16 ns) can be inferred for the helix formation reaction at 28 degrees C. These results demonstrate that secondary structure formation is fast enough to be a key event at early times in the protein-folding process and that helices are capable of forming before long range tertiary contacts are made.},

abstract = {To probe the experimental folding behavior of a large protein with complex topology, we created a monomeric variant of the lactose repressor protein (MLAc), a well characterized tetrameric protein that regulates transcription of the lac operon. Purified MLAc is folded, fully functional, and binds the inducer isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactoside with the same affinity as wild-type LacI. Equilibrium unfolding of MLAc induced by the chemical denaturant urea is a reversible, apparent two-state process (pH 7.5, 20 degrees C). However, time-resolved experiments demonstrate that unfolding is single-exponential, whereas refolding data indicate two transient intermediates. The data reveal the initial formation of a burst-phase (tau < ms) intermediate that corresponds to approximately 50\% of the total secondary-structure content. This step is followed by a rearrangement reaction that is rate-limited by an unfolding process (tau approximately 3 s; pH 7.5, 20 degrees C) and results in a second intermediate. This MLAc intermediate converts to the native structure (tau approximately 30 s; pH 7.5, 20 degrees C). Remarkably, the experimental folding-energy landscape for MLAc is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions using a simple topology-based C(alpha)-model as presented in a companion article in this issue.},

abstract = {A fundamental question is how enzymes can accelerate chemical reactions. Catalysis is not only defined by actual chemical steps, but also by enzyme structure and dynamics. To investigate the role of protein dynamics in enzymatic turnover, we measured residue-specific protein dynamics in hyperthermophilic and mesophilic homologs of adenylate kinase during catalysis. A dynamic process, the opening of the nucleotide-binding lids, was found to be rate-limiting for both enzymes as measured by NMR relaxation. Moreover, we found that the reduced catalytic activity of the hyperthermophilic enzyme at ambient temperatures is caused solely by a slower lid-opening rate. This comparative and quantitative study of activity, structure and dynamics revealed a close link between protein dynamics and catalytic turnover.},

Crystal structures are now available for the ligand-binding domain, but the structure of the ion channel itself remains unknown. The core of the ion channel shares structural features with an inverted K+ channel. In detail, however, differences are emerging. Most notable in the glutamate receptor ion channel are distinct structural and functional properties of a major pore-lining domain, the requirement of an additional transmembrane segment (M4), and twofold rather than fourfold symmetry. Together with ligand-binding domain structures and kinetic experiments, these findings have started to define the basic principles of channel gating in glutamate receptors.},

abstract = {The characterization of protein-folding kinetics with increasing chain length under various thermodynamic conditions is addressed using the capillarity picture in which distinct spatial regions of the protein are imagined to be folded or trapped and separated by interfaces. The quantitative capillarity theory is based on the nucleation theory of first-order transitions and the droplet analysis of glasses and random magnets. The concepts of folding funnels and rugged energy landscapes are shown to be applicable in the large size limit just as for smaller proteins. An ideal asymptotic free-energy profile as a function of a reaction coordinate measuring progress down the funnel is shown to be quite broad. This renders traditional transition state theory generally inapplicable but allows a diffusive picture with a transition-state region to be used. The analysis unifies several scaling arguments proposed earlier. The importance of fluctuational fine structure both to the free-energy profile and to the glassy dynamics is highlighted. The fluctuation effects lead to a very broad trapping-time distribution. Considerations necessary for understanding the crossover between the mean field and capillarity pictures of the energy landscapes are discussed. A variety of mechanisms that may roughen the interfaces and may lead to a complex structure of the transition-state ensemble are proposed.},

The search problem involved in folding however has been simplified through the evolution of folding energy landscapes that are funneled. The funnel hypothesis can be quantified using energy landscape theory based on the minimal frustration principle. Strong quantitative predictions that follow from energy landscape theory have been widely confirmed both through laboratory folding experiments and from detailed simulations. Energy landscape ideas also have allowed successful protein structure prediction algorithms to be developed. The selection constraint of having funneled folding landscapes has left its imprint on the sequences of existing protein structural families. Quantitative analysis of co-evolution patterns allows us to infer the statistical characteristics of the folding landscape. These turn out to be consistent with what has been obtained from laboratory physicochemical folding experiments signalling a beautiful confluence of genomics and chemical physics.},

The approach is based on a heuristic development starting from a resolution of the force–force correlation function of a Brownian ion, into parts depending on the attractive ion–solvent interaction and a repulsive, hard core ion–solvent interaction. We show that in the limit of infinitely weak, long range attractive ion–solvent interactions the molecular theory reduces to the phenomenological dielectric friction picture for the drag on an ion. The molecular theory also gives sensible results in the case of strong, short range attractive interactions. In this case the theory essentially indicates that the drag on the ion reduces to the drag on a composite body, i.e., a solventberg consisting of the ion and the molecules in the first solvation shell.},

abstract = {The detailed characterization of denatured proteins remains elusive due to their mobility and conformational heterogeneity. NMR studies are beginning to provide clues regarding residual structure in the denatured state but the resulting data are too sparse to be transformed into molecular models using conventional techniques. Molecular dynamics simulations can complement NMR by providing detailed structural information for components of the denatured ensemble. Here, we describe three independent 4 ns high-temperature molecular dynamics simulations of barnase in water. The simulated denatured state was conformationally heterogeneous with respect to the conformations populated both within a single simulation and between simulations. Nonetheless, there were some persistent interactions that occurred to varying degrees in all simulations and primarily involved the formation of fluid hydrophobic clusters with participating residues changing over time. The region of the beta(3-4) hairpin contained a particularly high degree of such side-chain interactions but it lacked beta-structure in two of the three denatured ensembles: beta(3-4) was the only portion of the beta-structure to contain significant residual structure in the denatured state. The two principal alpha-helices (alpha1 and alpha2) adopted dynamic helical structure. In addition, there were persistent contacts that pinched off core 2 from the body of the protein. The rest of the protein was unstructured, aside from transient and mostly local side-chain interactions. Overall, the simulated denatured state contains residual structure in the form of dynamic, fluctuating secondary structure in alpha1 and alpha2, as well as fluctuating tertiary contacts in the beta(3-4) region, and between alpha1 and beta(3-4), in agreement with previous NMR studies. Here, we also show that these regions containing residual structure display impaired mobility by both molecular dynamics and NMR relaxation experiments. The residual structure was important in decreasing the conformational states available to the chain and in repairing disrupted regions. For example, tertiary contacts between beta(3-4) and alpha1 assisted in the refolding of alpha1. This contact-assisted helix formation was confirmed in fragment simulations of beta(3-4) and alpha1 alone and complexed, and, as such, alpha1 and beta(3-4) appear to be folding initiation sites. The role of these sites in folding was investigated by working backwards and considering the simulation in reverse, noting that earlier time-points from the simulations provide models of the major intermediate and transition states in quantitative agreement with data from both unfolding and refolding experiments. Both beta(3-4) and alpha1 are dynamic in the denatured state but when they collide and make enough contacts, they provide a loose structural scaffold onto which further beta-strands pack. The beta-structure condenses about beta(3-4), while alpha1 aids in stabilizing beta(3-4) and maintaining its orientation. The resulting beta-structure is relatively planar and loose in the major intermediate. Further packing ensues, and as a result the beta-sheet twists, leading to the major transition state. The structure is still expanded and loops are not well formed at this point. Fine-tuning of the packing interactions and the final condensation of the structure then occurs to yield the native state.},

abstract = {The dynamical coupling between proteins and their hydration water is important for the understanding of macromolecular function in a cellular context. In the case of membrane proteins, the environment is heterogeneous, composed of lipids and hydration water, and the dynamical coupling might be more complex than in the case of the extensively studied soluble proteins. Here, we examine the dynamical coupling between a biological membrane, the purple membrane (PM), and its hydration water by a combination of elastic incoherent neutron scattering, specific deuteration, and molecular dynamics simulations. Examining completely deuterated PM, hydrated in H(2)O, allowed the direct experimental exploration of water dynamics. The study of natural abundance PM in D(2)O focused on membrane dynamics. The temperature-dependence of atomic mean-square displacements shows inflections at 120 K and 260 K for the membrane and at 200 K and 260 K for the hydration water. Because transition temperatures are different for PM and hydration water, we conclude that ps-ns hydration water dynamics are not directly coupled to membrane motions on the same time scale at temperatures <260 K. Molecular-dynamics simulations of hydrated PM in the temperature range from 100 to 296 K revealed an onset of hydration-water translational diffusion at approximately 200 K, but no transition in the PM at the same temperature. Our results suggest that, in contrast to soluble proteins, the dynamics of the membrane protein is not controlled by that of hydration water at temperatures <260 K. Lipid dynamics may have a stronger impact on membrane protein dynamics than hydration water.},

abstract = {Nucleic acid hairpins provide a powerful model system for probing the formation of secondary structure. We report a systematic study of the kinetics and thermodynamics of the folding transition for individual DNA hairpins of varying stem length, loop length, and stem GC content. Folding was induced mechanically in a high-resolution optical trap using a unique force clamp arrangement with fast response times. We measured 20 different hairpin sequences with quasi-random stem sequences that were 6-30 bp long, polythymidine loops that were 3-30 nt long, and stem GC content that ranged from 0\% to 100\%. For all hairpins studied, folding and unfolding were characterized by a single transition. From the force dependence of these rates, we determined the position and height of the energy barrier, finding that the transition state for duplex formation involves the formation of 1-2 bp next to the loop. By measuring unfolding energies spanning one order of magnitude, transition rates covering six orders of magnitude, and hairpin opening distances with subnanometer precision, our results define the essential features of the energy landscape for folding. We find quantitative agreement over the entire range of measurements with a hybrid landscape model that combines thermodynamic nearest-neighbor free energies and nanomechanical DNA stretching energies.},

abstract = {Folding may be described conceptually in terms of trajectories over a landscape of free energies corresponding to different molecular configurations. In practice, energy landscapes can be difficult to measure. Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), whereby structural changes are monitored in molecules subjected to controlled forces, has emerged as a powerful tool for probing energy landscapes. We summarize methods for reconstructing landscapes from force spectroscopy measurements under both equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. Other complementary, but technically less demanding, methods provide a model-dependent characterization of key features of the landscape. Once reconstructed, energy landscapes can be used to study critical folding parameters, such as the characteristic transition times required for structural changes and the effective diffusion coefficient setting the timescale for motions over the landscape. We also discuss issues that complicate measurement and interpretation, including the possibility of multiple states or pathways and the effects of projecting multiple dimensions onto a single coordinate.},

abstract = {Control of structural flexibility is essential for the proper functioning of a large number of proteins and multiprotein complexes. At the residue level, such flexibility occurs due to local relaxation of peptide bond angles whose cumulative effect may result in large changes in the secondary, tertiary or quaternary structures of protein molecules. Such flexibility, and its absence, most often depends on the nature of interdomain linkages formed by oligopeptides. Both flexible and relatively rigid peptide linkers are found in many multidomain proteins. Linkers are thought to control favorable and unfavorable interactions between adjacent domains by means of variable softness furnished by their primary sequence. Large-scale structural heterogeneity of multidomain proteins and their complexes, facilitated by soft peptide linkers, is now seen as the norm rather than the exception. Biophysical discoveries as well as computational algorithms and databases have reshaped our understanding of the often spectacular biomolecular dynamics enabled by soft linkers. Absence of such motion, as in so-called molecular rulers, also has desirable functional effects in protein architecture. We review here the historic discovery and current understanding of the nature of domains and their linkers from a structural, computational, and biophysical point of view. A number of emerging applications, based on the current understanding of the structural properties of peptides, are presented in the context of domain fusion of synthetic multifunctional chimeric proteins.},

Here we present a thermodynamic analysis of two transition states along different folding pathways for this protein. The unusual upwards curvature previously observed in the denaturant-dependent unfolding kinetics is increased at both high and low temperatures, indicating that the high denaturant pathway is becoming more accessible. The transition states in each pathway are structurally distinct and have very different heat capacities. Interestingly the nucleation-condensation pathway is dominant at all physiologically relevant temperatures, supporting the suggestion that pathways with diffuse rather than localised transition states have been selected for by evolution to prevent misfolding.},

abstract = {A major challenge in the post-genome era will be determination of the functions of the encoded protein sequences. Since it is generally assumed that the function of a protein is closely linked to its three-dimensional structure, prediction or experimental determination of the library of protein structures is a matter of high priority. However, a large proportion of gene sequences appear to code not for folded, globular proteins, but for long stretches of amino acids that are likely to be either unfolded in solution or adopt non-globular structures of unknown conformation. Characterization of the conformational propensities and function of the non-globular protein sequences represents a major challenge. The high proportion of these sequences in the genomes of all organisms studied to date argues for important, as yet unknown functions, since there could be no other reason for their persistence throughout evolution. Clearly the assumption that a folded three-dimensional structure is necessary for function needs to be re-examined. Although the functions of many proteins are directly related to their three-dimensional structures, numerous proteins that lack intrinsic globular structure under physiological conditions have now been recognized. Such proteins are frequently involved in some of the most important regulatory functions in the cell, and the lack of intrinsic structure in many cases is relieved when the protein binds to its target molecule. The intrinsic lack of structure can confer functional advantages on a protein, including the ability to bind to several different targets. It also allows precise control over the thermodynamics of the binding process and provides a simple mechanism for inducibility by phosphorylation or through interaction with other components of the cellular machinery. Numerous examples of domains that are unstructured in solution but which become structured upon binding to the target have been noted in the areas of cell cycle control and both transcriptional and translational regulation, and unstructured domains are present in proteins that are targeted for rapid destruction. Since such proteins participate in critical cellular control mechanisms, it appears likely that their rapid turnover, aided by their unstructured nature in the unbound state, provides a level of control that allows rapid and accurate responses of the cell to changing environmental conditions.},

Although NMR spectroscopy remains the favored tool, a number of new biophysical techniques are proving exceptionally useful in defining the limits of the conformational ensembles. Advances have been made in prediction of the recognition elements in disordered proteins, in elucidating the kinetics and mechanism of the coupled folding and binding process, and in understanding the role of post-translational modifications in tuning the biological response. Here we review these and other recent advances that are providing new insights into the conformational propensities and interactions of intrinsically disordered proteins and are beginning to reveal general principles underlying their biological functions.},

abstract = {Understanding the evolution of biopolymers is a key element in rationalizing their structures and functions. Simple exact models (SEMs) are well-positioned to address general principles of evolution as they permit the exhaustive enumeration of both sequence and structure (conformational) spaces. The physics-based models of the complete mapping between genotypes and phenotypes afforded by SEMs have proven valuable for gaining insight into how adaptation and selection operate among large collections of sequences and structures. This study compares the properties of evolutionary landscapes of a variety of SEMs to delineate robust predictions and possible model-specific artifacts. Among the models studied, the ruggedness of evolutionary landscape is significantly model-dependent; those derived from more protein-like models appear to be smoother. We found that a common practice of restricting protein structure space to maximally compact lattice conformations results in (i.e., "designs in") many encodable (designable) structures that are not otherwise encodable in the corresponding unrestrained structure space. This discrepancy is especially severe for model potentials that seek to mimic the major role of hydrophobic interactions in protein folding. In general, restricting conformations to be maximally compact leads to larger changes in the model genotype-phenotype mapping than a moderate shifting of reference state energy of the model potential function to allow for more specific encoding via the "designing out" effects of repulsive interactions. Despite these variations, the superfunnel paradigm applies to all SEMs we have tested: For a majority of neutral nets across different models, there exists a funnel-like organization of native stabilities for the sequences in a neutral net encoding for the same structure, and the thermodynamically most stable sequence is also the most robust against mutation.},

Despite this complexity, several elements underlying the aggregation process appear to be universal. The kinetics typically follows a nucleation-growth process, and proteins with very different sequences aggregate to form similar fibril structures, populating intermediates with sufficient structural similarity to bind to a common antibody. This review focuses on a computational approach that exploits the common features of aggregation to simplify or 'coarse-grain' the representation of the protein. We highlight recent developments in coarse-grained modeling and illustrate how these models have been able to shed new light into the mechanisms of protein aggregation and the nature of aggregation intermediates. The roles of aggregation prone conformations in the monomeric state and the influence of inherent $\beta$-sheet and aggregation propensities in modulating aggregation pathways are discussed.},

We show that the MaxCal strategy accurately predicts the full dynamics that we observe in the experiments: From the observed averages, it predicts second and third moments and covariances, with no free parameters.

abstract = {Many biologically interesting functions such as allosteric switching or protein-ligand binding are determined by the kinetics and mechanisms of transitions between various conformational substates of the native basin of globular proteins. To advance our understanding of these processes, we constructed a two-dimensional free energy surface (FES) of the native basin of a small globular protein, Trp-cage. The corresponding order parameters were defined using two native substructures of Trp-cage. These calculations were based on extensive explicit water all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Using the obtained two-dimensional FES, we studied the transition kinetics between two Trp-cage conformations, finding that switching process shows a borderline behavior between diffusive and weakly-activated dynamics. The transition is well-characterized kinetically as a biexponential process. We also introduced a new one-dimensional reaction coordinate for the conformational transition, finding reasonable qualitative agreement with the two-dimensional kinetics results. We investigated the distribution of all the 38 native nuclear magnetic resonance structures on the obtained FES, analyzing interactions that stabilize specific low-energy conformations. Finally, we constructed a FES for the same system but with simple dielectric model of water instead of explicit water, finding that the results were surprisingly similar in a small region centered on the native conformations. The dissimilarities between the explicit and implicit model on the larger-scale point to the important role of water in mediating interactions between amino acid residues.},

A variety of empirical correlations embodied in the concept of liquid "fragility" are shown to be quantitatively explained by such a model. The near universality of a Lindemann ratio characterizing the maximal amplitude of thermal vibrations within an amorphous minimum explains the variation of fragility with a liquid's configurational heat capacity density. Furthermore, the numerical prefactor of this correlation is well approximated by the microscopic calculation. The size of heterogeneous reconfiguring regions in a viscous liquid is inferred and the correlation of nonexponentiality of relaxation with fragility is qualitatively explained. Thus the wide variety of kinetic behavior in liquids of quite disparate chemical nature reflects quantitative rather than qualitative differences in their energy landscapes.},

abstract = {We have investigated the mechanism and the evolutionary pathway of protein dimerization through analysis of experimental structures of dimers. We propose that the evolution of dimers may have multiple pathways, including (1) formation of a functional dimer directly without going through an ancestor monomer, (2) formation of a stable monomer as an intermediate followed by mutations of its surface residues, and (3), a domain swapping mechanism, replacing one segment in a monomer by an equivalent segment from an identical chain in the dimer. Some of the dimers which are governed by a domain swapping mechanism may have evolved at an earlier stage of evolution via the second mechanism. Here, we follow the theory that the kinetic pathway reflects the evolutionary pathway. We analyze the structure-kinetics-evolution relationship for a collection of symmetric homodimers classified into three groups: (1) 14 dimers, which were referred to as domain swapping dimers in the literature; (2) nine 2-state dimers, which have no measurable intermediates in equilibrium denaturation; and (3), eight 3-state dimers, which have stable intermediates in equilibrium denaturation. The analysis consists of the following stages: (i) The dimer is divided into two structural units, which have twofold symmetry. Each unit contains a contiguous segment from one polypeptide chain of the dimer, and its complementary contiguous segment from the other chain. (ii) The division is repeated progressively, with different combinations of the two segments in each unit. (iii) The coefficient of compactness is calculated for the units in all divisions. The coefficients obtained for different cuttings of a dimer form a compactness profile. The profile probes the structural organization of the two chains in a dimer and the stability of the monomeric state. We describe the features of the compactness profiles in each of the three dimer groups. The profiles identify the swapping segments in domain swapping dimers, and can usually predict whether a dimer has domain swapping. The kinetics of dimerization indicates that some dimers which have been assigned in the literature as domain swapping cases, dimerize through the 2-state kinetics, rather than through swapping segments of performed monomers. The compactness profiles indicate a wide spectrum in the kinetics of dimerization: dimers having no intermediate stable monomers; dimers having an intermediate with a stable monomer structure; and dimers having an intermediate with a stable structure in part of the monomer. These correspond to the multiple evolutionary pathways for dimer formation. The evolutionary mechanisms proposed here for dimers are applicable to other oligomers as well.},

abstract = {Spider major ampullate (dragline) silk is an extracellular fibrous protein with unique characteristics of strength and elasticity. The silk fiber has been proposed to consist of pseudocrystalline regions of antiparallel beta-sheet interspersed with elastic amorphous segments. The repetitive sequence of a fibroin protein from major ampullate silk of the spider Nephila clavipes was determined from a partial cDNA clone. The repeating unit is a maximum of 34 amino acids long and is not rigidly conserved. The repeat unit is composed of three different segments: (i) a 6 amino acid segment that is conserved in sequence but has deletions of 3 or 6 amino acids in many of the repeats; (ii) a 13 amino acid segment dominated by a polyalanine sequence of 5-7 residues; (iii) a 15 amino acid, highly conserved segment. The latter is predominantly a Gly-Gly-Xaa repeat with Xaa being alanine, tyrosine, leucine, or glutamine. The codon usage for this DNA is highly selective, avoiding the use of cytosine or guanine in the third position. A model for the physical properties of fiber formation, strength, and elasticity, based on this repetitive protein sequence, is presented.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are highly ordered protein aggregates that are associated with several pathological processes, including prion propagation and Alzheimer's disease. A key issue in amyloid science is the need to understand the mechanical properties of amyloid fibrils and fibers to quantify biomechanical interactions with surrounding tissues, and to identify mechanobiological mechanisms associated with changes of material properties as amyloid fibrils grow from nanoscale to microscale structures. Here we report a series of computational studies in which atomistic simulation, elastic network modeling, and finite element simulation are utilized to elucidate the mechanical properties of Alzheimer's Abeta(1-40) amyloid fibrils as a function of the length of the protein filament for both twofold and threefold symmetric amyloid fibrils. We calculate the elastic constants associated with torsional, bending, and tensile deformation as a function of the size of the amyloid fibril, covering fibril lengths ranging from nanometers to micrometers. The resulting Young's moduli are found to be consistent with available experimental measurements obtained from long amyloid fibrils, and predicted to be in the range of 20-31 GPa. Our results show that Abeta(1-40) amyloid fibrils feature a remarkable structural stability and mechanical rigidity for fibrils longer than approximately 100 nm. However, local instabilities that emerge at the ends of short fibrils (on the order of tens of nanometers) reduce their stability and contribute to their disassociation under extreme mechanical or chemical conditions, suggesting that longer amyloid fibrils are more stable. Moreover, we find that amyloids with lengths shorter than the periodicity of their helical pitch, typically between 90 and 130 nm, feature significant size effects of their bending stiffness due the anisotropy in the fibril's cross section. At even smaller lengths (50 nm), shear effects dominate lateral deformation of amyloid fibrils, suggesting that simple Euler-Bernoulli beam models fail to describe the mechanics of amyloid fibrils appropriately. Our studies reveal the importance of size effects in elucidating the mechanical properties of amyloid fibrils. This issue is of great importance for comparing experimental and simulation results, and gaining a general understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the growth of ectopic amyloid materials.},

We tested this hypothesis by using a simplified model for the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 src homology 3 domain protein, both of whose monomeric and domain-swapped structures have been solved. The model, which we call the symmetrized Gō-type model, incorporates only information regarding the monomeric conformation in an energy function for the dimer to predict the domain-swapped conformation. A striking preference for the correct domain-swapped structure was observed, indicating that overall monomer topology is a main determinant of the structure of domain-swapped dimers. Furthermore, we explore the free energy surface for domain swapping by using our model to characterize the mechanism of oligomerization.},

However, the BPT lacks a clear intermonomer binding mechanism. Here we propose an alternative domain-swapped trimeric prion (DSTP) model and show with molecular dynamics (MD) that the DSTP has more favorable intermonomer hydrogen bonding and proline dihedral strain energy than the BPT. This new structural proposal may be tested by lysine and N terminus fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) either directly on recombinant prion protein amyloid aggregates or on synthetic constructs that contain the proline/lysine-rich hinge region critical for domains to swap. In addition, the domain swapping may provide 1) intrinsic entanglement, which can contribute to the remarkable temperature stability of the infectious prion structure and help explain the absence of PrP(Sc) monomers, 2) insight into why specific prolines are potentially relevant to three inherited forms of prion disease, and 3) a simple explanation of prion strains assuming the strain is encoded in the monomer number of the oligomers.},

abstract = {Domain swapping has been shown to be an important mechanism controlling multiprotein assembly and has been suggested recently as a possible mechanism underlying protein aggregation. Understanding oligomerization via domain swapping is therefore of theoretical and practical importance. By using a symmetrized structure-based (Gō) model, we demonstrate that in the free-energy landscape of domain swapping, a large free-energy barrier separates monomeric and domain-swapped dimeric configurations. We investigate the effect of finite monomer concentration, by implementing a new semi-analytical method, which involves computing the second virial coefficient, a thermodynamic indicator of inter-molecular interactions. This method, together with the symmetrized structure-based (Gō) model, minimizes the need for expensive many-protein simulations, providing a convenient framework to investigate concentration effect. Finally, we perform direct simulations of domain-swapped trimer formation, showing that this modeling approach can be used for higher-order oligomers. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We show that the five-helix bundle lambda(6-85) can be engineered and solvent-tuned to make the transition from activated two-state folding to downhill folding. The transition manifests itself as the appearance of additional dynamics faster than the activated kinetics, followed by the disappearance of the activated kinetics when the bias toward the native state is increased. Our fastest value of 1 micros for the "speed" limit of lambda(6-85) is measured at low concentrations of a denaturant that smooths the free-energy surface. Complete disappearance of the activated phase is obtained in stabilizing glucose buffer. Langevin dynamics on a rough free-energy surface with variable bias toward the native state provides a robust and quantitative description of the transition from activated to downhill folding. Based on our simulation, we estimate the residual energetic frustration of lambda(6-85) to be delta(2) G approximately 0.64 k(2)T(2). We show that lambda(6-86), as well as very fast folding proteins or folding intermediates estimated to lie near the speed limit, provide a better rate-topology correlation than proteins with larger energetic frustration. A limit of beta > or = 0.7 on any stretching of lambda(6-85) barrier-free dynamics suggests that a low-dimensional free-energy surface is sufficient to describe folding.},

abstract = {Identification of pathways involved in the structural transitions of biomolecular systems is often complicated by the transient nature of the conformations visited across energy barriers and the multiplicity of paths accessible in the multidimensional energy landscape. This task becomes even more challenging in exploring molecular systems on the order of megadaltons. Coarse-grained models that lend themselves to analytical solutions appear to be the only possible means of approaching such cases. Motivated by the utility of elastic network models for describing the collective dynamics of biomolecular systems and by the growing theoretical and experimental evidence in support of the intrinsic accessibility of functional substates, we introduce a new method, adaptive anisotropic network model (aANM), for exploring functional transitions. Application to bacterial chaperonin GroEL and comparisons with experimental data, results from action minimization algorithm, and previous simulations support the utility of aANM as a computationally efficient, yet physically plausible, tool for unraveling potential transition pathways sampled by large complexes/assemblies.

abstract = {The NMDA receptor family of glutamate receptor ion channels is formed by obligate heteromeric assemblies of GluN1, GluN2, and GluN3 subunits. GluN1 and GluN3 bind glycine, whereas GluN2 binds glutamate. Crystal structures of the GluN1 and GluN3A ligand-binding domains (LBDs) in their apo states unexpectedly reveal open- and closed-cleft conformations, respectively, with water molecules filling the binding pockets. Computed conformational free energy landscapes for GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN3A LBDs reveal that the apo-state LBDs sample closed-cleft conformations, suggesting that their agonists bind via a conformational selection mechanism. By contrast, free energy landscapes for the AMPA receptor GluA2 LBD suggest binding of glutamate via an induced-fit mechanism. Principal component analysis reveals a rich spectrum of hinge bending, rocking, twisting, and sweeping motions that are different for the GluN1, GluN2A, GluN3A, and GluA2 LBDs. This variation highlights the structural complexity of signaling by glutamate receptor ion channels.},

abstract = {Recent experimental studies have shown that amyloid fibril formed by aggregation of $\beta$ peptide exhibits excellent mechanical properties comparable to other protein materials such as actin filaments and microtubules. These excellent mechanical properties of amyloid fibrils are related to their functional role in disease expression. This indicates the necessity of understanding how an amyloid fibril achieves the remarkable mechanical properties through self-aggregation with structural hierarchy. However, the structure-property–function relationship still remains elusive. In this work, the mechanical properties of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) are studied with respect to its structural hierarchies and structural shapes by coarse-grained normal mode analysis. The simulation shows that hIAPP fibril can achieve the excellent bending rigidity via specific aggregation patterns such as antiparallel stacking of $\beta$ peptides. Moreover, the length-dependent mechanical properties of amyloids are found. This length-dependent property has been elucidated from a Timoshenko beam model that takes into account the shear effect on the bending of amyloids. In summary, the study sheds light on the importance of not only the molecular architecture, which encodes the mechanical properties of the fibril, but also the shear effect on the mechanical (bending) behavior of the fibril.},

Examples of spectrin repeat-containing proteins include dystrophin, alpha-actinin and spectrin itself--all proteins with well-demonstrated roles of establishing and maintaining cell structure. Over the past decade, it has become clear that, although these proteins display a cytoplasmic and plasma membrane distribution, several are also found both at the nuclear envelope, and within the intranuclear space. In this review, we provide an overview of recent work regarding various spectrin repeat-containing structural proteins in the nucleus. As well, we hypothesize about the regulation of their nuclear localization and possible nuclear functions based on domain architecture, known interacting proteins and evolutionary relationships. Given their large size, and their potential for interacting with multiple proteins and with chromatin, spectrin repeat-containing proteins represent strong candidates for important organizational proteins within the nucleus.

abstract = {Protein misfolding is a ubiquitous phenomenon associated with a wide range of diseases. Single-molecule approaches offer a powerful tool for deciphering the mechanisms of misfolding by measuring the conformational fluctuations of a protein with high sensitivity. We applied single-molecule force spectroscopy to observe directly the misfolding of the prion protein PrP, a protein notable for having an infectious misfolded state that is able to propagate by recruiting natively folded PrP. By measuring folding trajectories of single PrP molecules held under tension in a high-resolution optical trap, we found that the native folding pathway involves only two states, without evidence for partially folded intermediates that have been proposed to mediate misfolding. Instead, frequent but fleeting transitions were observed into off-pathway intermediates. Three different misfolding pathways were detected, all starting from the unfolded state. Remarkably, the misfolding rate was even higher than the rate for native folding. A mutant PrP with higher aggregation propensity showed increased occupancy of some of the misfolded states, suggesting these states may act as intermediates during aggregation. These measurements of individual misfolding trajectories demonstrate the power of single-molecule approaches for characterizing misfolding directly by mapping out nonnative folding pathways.},

abstract = {We have used distributed computing techniques and a supercluster of thousands of computer processors to study folding of the C-terminal beta-hairpin from protein G in atomistic detail using the GB/SA implicit solvent model at 300 K. We have simulated a total of nearly 38 micros of folding time and obtained eight complete and independent folding trajectories. Starting from an extended state, we observe relaxation to an unfolded state characterized by non-specific, temporary hydrogen bonding. This is followed by the appearance of interactions between hydrophobic residues that stabilize a bent intermediate. Final formation of the complete hydrophobic core occurs cooperatively at the same time that the final hydrogen bonding pattern appears. The folded hairpin structures we observe all contain a closely packed hydrophobic core and proper beta-sheet backbone dihedral angles, but they differ in backbone hydrogen bonding pattern. We show that this is consistent with the existing experimental data on the hairpin alone in solution. Our analysis also reveals short-lived semi-helical intermediates which define a thermodynamic trap. Our results are consistent with a three-state mechanism with a single rate-limiting step in which a varying final hydrogen bond pattern is apparent, and semi-helical off-pathway intermediates may appear early in the folding process. We include details of the ensemble dynamics methodology and a discussion of our achievements using this new computational device for studying dynamics at the atomic level.},

abstract = {Using synchrotron radiation and the small-angle X-ray scattering technique we have measured the radii of gyration of a series of alanine-based alpha-helix-forming peptides of the composition Ace-(AAKAA)(n)-GY-NH(2), n=2-7, in aqueous solvent at 10(+/-1) degrees C. In contrast to other techniques typically used to study alpha-helices in isolation (such as nuclear magnetic resonance and circular dichroism), small-angle X-ray scattering reports on the global structure of a molecule and, as such, provides complementary information to these other, more sequence-local measuring techniques. The radii of gyration that we measure are, except for the 12-mer, lower than the radii of gyration of ideal alpha-helices or helices with frayed ends of the equivalent sequence-length. For example, the measured radius of gyration of the 37-mer is 14.2(+/-0.6)A, which is to be compared with the radius of gyration of an ideal 37-mer alpha-helix of 17.6A. Attempts are made to analyze the origin of this discrepancy in terms of the analytical Zimm-Bragg-Nagai (ZBN) theory, as well as distributed computing explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations using two variants of the AMBER force-field. The ZBN theory, which treats helices as cylinders connected by random walk segments, predicts markedly larger radii of gyration than those measured. This is true even when the persistence length of the random walk parts is taken to be extremely short (about one residue). Similarly, the molecular dynamics simulations, at the level of sampling available to us, give inaccurate values of the radii of gyration of the molecules (by overestimating them by around 25\% for longer peptides) and/or their helical content. We conclude that even at the short sequences examined here (< or =37 amino acid residues), these alpha-helical peptides behave as fluctuating semi-broken rods rather than straight cylinders with frayed ends.},

After examining thousands of simulations of both the folded and the unfolded states of five polypeptides in atomistic detail at room temperature, we report here a result that seems at odds with the mean-structure hypothesis. Specifically, the average inter-residue distances in the collapsed unfolded structures agree well with the statistics of the ideal random-flight chain with link length of 3.8 A (the length of one amino acid). A possible resolution of this apparent contradiction is offered by the observation that the inter-residue distances in a typical alpha-helix over short stretches are close to the average distances in an ideal random-flight chain.},

abstract = {Recent algorithmic advances and continual increase in computational power have made it possible to simulate protein folding and dynamics on the level of ensembles. Furthermore, analyzing protein structure by using ensemble representation is intrinsic to certain experimental techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance. This creates a problem of how to compare an ensemble of molecules with a given reference structure. Recently, we used distance-based root-mean-square deviation (dRMS) to compare the native structure of a protein with its unfolded-state ensemble. We showed that for small, mostly alpha-helical proteins, the mean unfolded-state Calpha-Calpha distance matrix is significantly more nativelike than the Calpha-Calpha matrices corresponding to the individual members of the unfolded ensemble. Here, we give a mathematical derivation that shows that, for any ensemble of structures, the dRMS deviation between the ensemble-averaged distance matrix and any given reference distance matrix is always less than or equal to the average dRMS deviation of the individual members of the ensemble from the same reference matrix. This holds regardless of the nature of the reference structure or the structural ensemble in question. In other words, averaging of distance matrices can only increase their level of similarity to a given reference matrix, relative to the individual matrices comprising the ensemble. Furthermore, we show that the above inequality holds in the case of Cartesian coordinate-based root-mean-square deviation as well. We discuss this in the context of our proposal that the average structure of the unfolded ensemble of small helical proteins is close to the native structure, and demonstrate that this finding goes beyond the above mathematical fact.},

abstract = {Structural database-derived propensities for amino acids to adopt particular local protein structures, such as alpha-helix and beta-strand, have long been recognized and effectively exploited for the prediction of protein secondary structure. However, the experimental verification of database-derived propensities using mutagenesis studies has been problematic, especially for beta-strand propensities, because local structural preferences are often confounded by non-local interactions arising from formation of the native tertiary structure. Thus, the overall thermodynamic stability of a protein is not always altered in a predictable manner by changes in local structural propensity at a single position. In this study, we have undertaken an investigation of the relationship between beta-strand propensity and protein folding kinetics. By characterizing the effects of a wide variety of amino acid substitutions at two different beta-strand positions in an SH3 domain, we have found that the observed changes in protein folding rates are very well correlated to beta-strand propensities for almost all of the substitutions examined. In contrast, there is little correlation between propensities and unfolding rates. These data indicate that beta-strand conformation is well formed in the structured portion of the SH3 domain transition state, and that local structure propensity strongly influences the stability of the transition state. Since the transition state is known to be packed more loosely than the native state and likely lacks many of the non-local stabilizing interactions seen in the native state, we suggest that folding kinetics studies may generally provide an effective means for the experimental validation of database-derived local structural propensities.},

abstract = {Theoretical and experimental studies of protein folding have suggested that the topology of the native state may be the most important factor determining the folding pathway of a protein, independent of its specific amino acid sequence. To test this concept, many experimental studies have been carried out with the aim of comparing the folding pathways of proteins that possess similar tertiary structures, but divergent sequences. Many of these studies focus on quantitative comparisons of folding transition state structures, as determined by Phi(f) value analysis of folding kinetic data. In some of these studies, folding transition state structures are found to be highly conserved, whereas in others they are not. We conclude that folds displaying more conserved transition state structures may have the most restricted number of possible folding pathways and that folds displaying low transition state structural conservation possess many potential pathways for reaching the native state.},

abstract = {Many experimental and theoretical studies have suggested a significant role for nonnative interactions in protein folding pathways, but the energetic contributions of these interactions are not well understood. We have addressed the energetics and the position specificity of nonnative hydrophobic interactions by developing a continuum coarse-grained chain model with a native-centric potential augmented by sequence-dependent hydrophobic interactions. By modeling the effect of different hydrophobicity values at various positions in the Fyn SH3 domain, we predicted energetically significant nonnative interactions that led to acceleration or deceleration of the folding rate depending on whether they were more populated in the transition state or unfolded state. These nonnative contacts were centered on position 53 in the Fyn SH3 domain, which lies in an exposed position in a 3(10)-helix. The energetic importance of the predicted nonnative interactions was confirmed experimentally by folding kinetics studies combined with double mutant thermodynamic cycles. By attaining agreement of theoretical and experimental investigations, this study provides a compelling demonstration that specific nonnative interactions can significantly influence folding energetics. Moreover, we show that a coarse-grained model with a simple consideration of hydrophobicity is sufficient for the accurate prediction of kinetically important nonnative interactions.},

abstract = {Stem cell differentiation has been viewed as coming from transitions between attractors on an epigenetic landscape that governs the dynamics of a regulatory network involving many genes. Rigorous definition of such a landscape is made possible by the realization that gene regulation is stochastic, owing to the small copy number of the transcription factors that regulate gene expression and because of the single-molecule nature of the gene itself. We develop an approximation that allows the quantitative construction of the epigenetic landscape for large realistic model networks. Applying this approach to the network for embryonic stem cell development explains many experimental observations, including the heterogeneous distribution of the transcription factor Nanog and its role in safeguarding the stem cell pluripotency, which can be understood by finding stable steady-state attractors and the most probable transition paths between those attractors. We also demonstrate that the switching rate between attractors can be significantly influenced by the gene expression noise arising from the fluctuations of DNA occupancy when binding to a specific DNA site is slow.},

abstract = {The Greek key motifs are the topological signature of many beta-barrels and a majority of beta-sandwich structures. An updated survey of these structures integrates many early observations and newly emerging patterns and provides a better understanding of the unique role of Greek keys in protein structures. A stereotypical Greek key beta-barrel accommodates five or six strands and can have 12 possible topologies. All except one six-stranded topologies have been observed, and only one five-stranded topologies have been seen in actual structures. Of the representative beta-barrel structures analyzed here, half have left-handed Greek keys. This result challenges the empirical claim of the handedness regularity of Greek keys in beta-barrels. One of the five-stranded topologies that has not been observed in beta-barrels comprises two overlapping Greek keys. The two three-dimensional forms of this topology constitute a structural unit that is present in a vast majority of known beta-sandwich structures. Using this unit as the root, we have built a new taxonomy tree for the beta-sandwich folds and deduced a set of rules that appear to constrain how other beta-strands adjoin the unit to form a larger double-layered structure. These rules, though derived from a larger data set, are essentially the same as those drawn from earlier studies, suggesting that they may reflect the true topological constraints in the design of beta-sandwich structures. Finally, a novel variant of the Greek key motif (defined here as the twisted Greek key) has emerged which introduces loop crossings into the folded structures. Proteins 2000;40:409-419.},

HD pathology is characterized by neuronal degeneration and protein inclusions containing N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin. Structural information is minimal, though it is believed that mutant huntingtin polyglutamine adopts $\beta$ structure upon conversion to a toxic form. To this end, we designed mammalian cell expression constructs encoding compact $\beta$ variants of Htt exon 1 N-terminal fragment and tested their ability to aggregate and induce toxicity in cultured neuronal cells. In parallel, we performed molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that constructs with expanded polyglutamine $\beta$-strands are stabilized by main-chain hydrogen bonding. Finally, we found a correlation between the reactivity to 3B5H10, an expanded polyglutamine antibody that recognizes a compact $\beta$ rich hairpin structure, and the ability to induce cell toxicity. These data are consistent with an important role for a compact $\beta$ structure in mutant huntingtin-induced cell toxicity.},

The algorithm is approximately 4 times faster than CE and 20 times faster than DALI and SAL. On average, the resulting structure alignments have higher accuracy and coverage than those provided by these most often-used methods. TM-align is applied to an all-against-all structure comparison of 10 515 representative protein chains from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a sequence identity cutoff <95\%: 1996 distinct folds are found when a TM-score threshold of 0.5 is used. We also use TM-align to match the models predicted by TASSER for solved non-homologous proteins in PDB. For both folded and misfolded models, TM-align can almost always find close structural analogs, with an average root mean square deviation, RMSD, of 3 A and 87\% alignment coverage. Nevertheless, there exists a significant correlation between the correctness of the predicted structure and the structural similarity of the model to the other proteins in the PDB. This correlation could be used to assist in model selection in blind protein structure predictions. The TM-align program is freely downloadable at http://bioinformatics.buffalo.edu/TM-align.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) models of biomolecules have recently attracted considerable interest because they enable the simulation of complex biological systems on length-scales and timescales that are inaccessible for atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. A CG model is defined by a map that transforms an atomically detailed configuration into a CG configuration. For CG models of relatively small biomolecules or in cases that the CG and all-atom models have similar resolution, the construction of this map is relatively straightforward and can be guided by chemical intuition. However, it is more challenging to construct a CG map when large and complex domains of biomolecules have to be represented by relatively few CG sites. This work introduces a new and systematic methodology called essential dynamics coarse-graining (ED-CG). This approach constructs a CG map of the primary sequence at a chosen resolution for an arbitrarily complex biomolecule. In particular, the resulting ED-CG method variationally determines the CG sites that reflect the essential dynamics characterized by principal component analysis of an atomistic molecular dynamics trajectory. Numerical calculations illustrate this approach for the HIV-1 CA protein dimer and ATP-bound G-actin. Importantly, since the CG sites are constructed from the primary sequence of the biomolecule, the resulting ED-CG model may be better suited to appropriately explore protein conformational space than those from other CG methods at the same degree of resolution.},

In apparent agreement with experiment, we found that coarse-grained, native-centric chain models, including potentials with and without elementary desolvation barriers, predicted that Top7 has a stable intermediate state in which the C-terminal fragment is folded while the rest of the chain remains disordered. We observed noncooperative folding in Top7 models that incorporated nonnative hydrophobic interactions as well. In contrast, free energy profiles deduced from models with desolvation barriers for a set of thirteen natural proteins with similar chain lengths and secondary structure elements suggested that they fold much more cooperatively than Top7. Buttressed by related studies on smaller natural proteins with chain lengths of approximately 40 residues, our findings argue that the de novo native topology of Top7 likely imposed a significant restriction on the cooperativity achievable by any design for this target structure.},

abstract = {Fundamental relationships between the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding were investigated using chain models of natural proteins with diverse folding rates by extensive comparisons between the distribution of conformations in thermodynamic equilibrium and the distribution of conformations sampled along folding trajectories. Consistent with theory and single-molecule experiment, duration of the folding transition paths exhibits only a weak correlation with overall folding time. Conformational distributions of folding trajectories near the overall thermodynamic folding/unfolding barrier show significant deviations from preequilibrium. These deviations, the distribution of transition path times, and the variation of mean transition path time for different proteins can all be rationalized by a diffusive process that we modeled using simple Monte Carlo algorithms with an effective coordinate-independent diffusion coefficient. Conformations in the initial stages of transition paths tend to form more nonlocal contacts than typical conformations with the same number of native contacts. This statistical bias, which is indicative of preferred folding pathways, should be amenable to future single-molecule measurements. We found that the preexponential factor defined in the transition state theory of folding varies from protein to protein and that this variation can be rationalized by our Monte Carlo diffusion model. Thus, protein folding physics is different in certain fundamental respects from the physics envisioned by a simple transition-state picture. Nonetheless, transition state theory can be a useful approximate predictor of cooperative folding speed, because the height of the overall folding barrier is apparently a proxy for related rate-determining physical properties.},

abstract = {We compared folding properties of designed protein Top7 and natural protein S6 by using coarse-grained chain models with a mainly native-centric construct that accounted also for nonnative hydrophobic interactions and desolvation barriers. Top7 and S6 have similar secondary structure elements and are approximately equal in length and hydrophobic composition. Yet their experimental folding kinetics were drastically different. Consistent with experiment, our simulated folding chevron arm for Top7 exhibited a severe rollover, whereas that for S6 was essentially linear, and Top7 model kinetic relaxation was multiphasic under strongly folding conditions. The peculiar behavior of Top7 was associated with several classes of kinetic traps in our model. Significantly, the amino acid residues participating in nonnative interactions in trapped conformations in our Top7 model overlapped with those deduced experimentally. These affirmations suggest that the simple ingredients of native topology plus sequence-dependent nonnative interactions are sufficient to account for some key features of protein folding kinetics. Notably, when nonnative interactions were absent in the model, Top7 chevron rollover was not correctly predicted. In contrast, nonnative interactions had little effect on the quasi linearity of the model folding chevron arm for S6. This intriguing distinction indicates that folding cooperativity is governed by a subtle interplay between the sequence-dependent driving forces for native topology and the locations of favorable nonnative interactions entailed by the same sequence. Constructed with a capability to mimic this interplay, our simple modeling approach should be useful in general for assessing a designed sequence's potential to fold cooperatively.},

While RE simulations generate a large set of discrete states with the correct thermodynamics, kinetic information is lost due to the random exchange of temperatures. We show how we can recover the kinetics of a 2D continuous potential with an entropic barrier by using RE-generated discrete states as nodes of a kinetic network. By choosing the neighbors and the microscopic rates between the neighbors appropriately, the correct kinetics of the system can be recovered by running a kinetic simulation on the network. We fine-tune the parameters of the network by comparison with the effective drift velocities and diffusion coefficients of the system determined from short-time stochastic trajectories. One of the advantages of the kinetic network model is that the network can be built on a high-dimensional discretized state space, which can consist of multiple paths not consistent with a single reaction coordinate.},

abstract = {We investigate protein-protein association using the associative-memory, water-mediated, structure, and energy model (AWSEM), a coarse-grained protein folding model that has been optimized using energy-landscape theory. The potential was originally parameterized by enforcing a funneled nature for a database of dimeric interfaces but was later further optimized to create funneled folding landscapes for individual monomeric proteins. The ability of the model to predict interfaces was not tested previously. The present results show that simulated annealing of the model indeed is able to predict successfully the native interfaces of eight homodimers and four heterodimers, thus amounting to a flexible docking algorithm. We go on to address the relative importance of monomer geometry, flexibility, and nonnative intermonomeric contacts in the association process for the homodimers. Monomer surface geometry is found to be important in determining the binding interface, but it is insufficient. Using a uniform binding potential rather than the water-mediated potential results in sampling of misbound structures that are geometrically preferred but are nonetheless energetically disfavored by AWSEM, as well as in nature. Depending on the stability of the unbound monomers, nonnative contacts play different roles in the association process. For unstable monomers, thermodynamic states stabilized by nonnative interactions correspond to productive, on-pathway intermediates and can, therefore, catalyze binding through a fly-casting mechanism. For stable monomers, in contrast, states stabilized by nonnative interactions generally correspond to traps that impede binding.},

abstract = {Frustration from strong interdomain interactions can make misfolding a more severe problem in multidomain proteins than in single-domain proteins. On the basis of bioinformatic surveys, it has been suggested that lowering the sequence identity between neighboring domains is one of nature's solutions to the multidomain misfolding problem. We investigate folding of multidomain proteins using the associative-memory, water-mediated, structure and energy model (AWSEM), a predictive coarse-grained protein force field. We find that reducing sequence identity not only decreases the formation of domain-swapped contacts but also decreases the formation of strong self-recognition contacts between $\beta$-strands with high hydrophobic content. The ensembles of misfolded structures that result from forming these amyloid-like interactions are energetically disfavored compared with the native state, but entropically favored. Therefore, these ensembles are more stable than the native ensemble under denaturing conditions, such as high temperature. Domain-swapped contacts compete with self-recognition contacts in forming various trapped states, and point mutations can shift the balance between the two types of interaction. We predict that multidomain proteins that lack these specific strong interdomain interactions should fold reliably.},

abstract = {Experiments on artificial multidomain protein constructs have probed the early stages of aggregation processes, but structural details of the species that initiate aggregation remain elusive. Using the associative-memory, water-mediated, structure and energy model known as AWSEM, a transferable coarse-grained protein model, we performed simulations of fused constructs composed of up to four copies of the Titin I27 domain or its mutant I27* (I59E). Free energy calculations enable us to quantify the conditions under which such multidomain constructs will spontaneously misfold. Consistent with experimental results, the dimer of I27 is found to be the smallest spontaneously misfolding construct. Our results show how structurally distinct misfolded states can be stabilized under different thermodynamic conditions, and this result provides a plausible link between the single-molecule misfolding experiments under native conditions and aggregation experiments under denaturing conditions. The conditions for spontaneous misfolding are determined by the interplay among temperature, effective local protein concentration, and the strength of the interdomain interactions. Above the folding temperature, fusing additional domains to the monomer destabilizes the native state, and the entropically stabilized amyloid-like state is favored. Because it is primarily energetically stabilized, the domain-swapped state is more likely to be important under native conditions. Both protofibril-like and branching structures are found in annealing simulations starting from extended structures, and these structures suggest a possible connection between the existence of multiple amyloidogenic segments in each domain and the formation of branched, amorphous aggregates as opposed to linear fibrillar structures.},

abstract = {Several methods have been developed in the past few years for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations of biological (macro)molecules whose complexity is difficult to capture by simple projections of the free-energy surface onto one or two geometric variables. The locally scaled diffusion map (LSDMap) method is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique for describing the dynamics of complex systems in terms of a few collective coordinates. Here, we compare LSDMap to two previously developed approaches for the characterization of the configurational landscape associated with the folding dynamics of a three-stranded antiparallel $\beta$-sheet peptide, termed Beta3s. The analysis is aided by an improved procedure for extracting pathways from the equilibrium transition network, which enables calculation of pathway-specific cut-based free energy profiles. We find that the results from LSDMap are consistent with analysis based on transition networks and allow a coherent interpretation of metastable states and folding pathways in terms of different time scales of transitions between minima on the free energy projections.},

Phys. 128, 114903 (2008)] demonstrated that the reaction rate cannot be reproduced by projecting the dynamics onto a single empirical reaction coordinate, a result suggesting the dynamics of this system cannot be correctly described by using a single collective coordinate. To further investigate this possibility we have applied our recently developed multiscale framework, locally scaled diffusion map (LSDMap), to obtain collective reaction coordinates for this system. Using a single diffusion coordinate, we obtain a reversal rate via Kramers expression that is in good agreement with the exact rate obtained from the simulations. Our mathematically rigorous approach accounts for the local heterogeneity of molecular configuration space in constructing a diffusion map, from which collective coordinates emerge. We believe this approach can be applied in general to characterize complex macromolecular dynamics by providing an accurate definition of the collective coordinates associated with processes at different time scales.},

In this paper, we introduce a new sampling scheme, named Diffusion Map-directed-MD (DM-d-MD), to rapidly explore molecular configuration space. The method uses diffusion map to guide MD on the fly. DM-d-MD can be combined with other methods to reconstruct the equilibrium free energy, and here we used umbrella sampling as an example. We present results from two systems: alanine dipeptide and alanine-12. In both systems we gain tremendous speedup with respect to standard MD both in exploring the configuration space and reconstructing the equilibrium distribution. In particular, we obtain 3 orders of magnitude of speedup over standard MD in the exploration of the configurational space of alanine-12 at 300K with DM-d-MD. The method is reaction coordinate free and minimally dependent on a priori knowledge of the system. We expect wide applications of DM-d-MD to other macromolecular systems in which equilibrium sampling is not affordable by standard MD.},

An attempt is made to clear up a number of misconceptions in the literature regarding popular rate theories, including the appearance of Planck's constant in the transition-state theory and the Smoluchowski result as an upper limit for protein-protein and protein-DNA association rate constants. Future work in combining the implementation of rate theories through computer simulations with experimental probes of rate processes, and in modeling effects of intracellular environments so that theories can be used for generating rate constants for systems biology studies is particularly exciting.},

abstract = {Trp-cage is a 20-residue miniprotein, which is believed to be the fastest folder known so far. In this study, the folding free energy landscape of Trp-cage has been explored in explicit solvent by using an OPLSAA force field with periodic boundary condition. A highly parallel replica exchange molecular dynamics method is used for the conformation space sampling, with the help of a recently developed efficient molecular dynamics algorithm P3ME/RESPA (particle-particle particle-mesh Ewald/reference system propagator algorithm). A two-step folding mechanism is proposed that involves an intermediate state where two correctly formed partial hydrophobic cores are separated by an essential salt-bridge between residues Asp-9 and Arg-16 near the center of the peptide. This metastable intermediate state provides an explanation for the superfast folding process. The free energy landscape is found to be rugged at low temperatures, and then becomes smooth and funnel-like above 340 K. The lowest free energy structure at 300 K is only 1.50 A Calpha-RMSD (Calpha-rms deviation) from the NMR structures. The simulated nuclear Overhauser effect pair distances are in excellent agreement with the raw NMR data. The temperature dependence of the Trp-cage population, however, is found to be significantly different from experiment, with a much higher melting transition temperature above 400 K (experimental 315 K), indicating that the current force fields, parameterized at room temperature, need to be improved to correctly predict the temperature dependence.},

abstract = {Understanding protein folding is one of the most challenging problems remaining in molecular biology. In this chapter, a highly parallel replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) method and its application to protein folding are described. The REMD method couples molecular dynamics trajectories with a temperature exchange Monte Carlo process for efficient sampling of the conformational space. A series of replicas are run in parallel at temperatures ranging from the desired temperature to a high temperature at which the replica can easily surmount the energy barriers. From time to time the configurations of neighboring replicas are exchanged and this exchange is accepted or rejected based on a Metropolis acceptance criterion that guarantees the detailed balance. Two example protein systems, one alpha-helix and one beta-hairpin, are used as case studies to demonstrate the power of the algorithm. Up to 64 replicas of solvated protein systems are simulated in parallel over a wide range of temperatures. The simulation results show that the combined trajectories in temperature and configurational space allow a replica to overcome free energy barriers present at low temperatures. These large-scale simulations also reveal detailed results on folding mechanisms, intermediate state structures, thermodynamic properties, and the temperature dependences for both protein systems.},

Water depletion and hydrophobic collapse occur on a nanosecond time scale, which is two orders of magnitude slower than that found in the collapse of idealized paraffin-like plates. When the electrostatic protein-water forces are turned off, a dewetting transition occurs in the interdomain region and the collapse speeds up by more than an order of magnitude.

Here a Calpha-based three-helix-bundle-like protein model with a realistic thermodynamic phase diagram is used to calculate several hundred folding trajectories. By varying a single parameter, the difference between the strength of native and non-native contacts, folding is changed from a diffusion-collision mechanism to one that involves simultaneous collapse and partial secondary-structure formation, followed by reorganization to the native structure. Non-obligatory intermediates are important in the former, whereas there is an obligatory on-pathway intermediate in the latter.

The results confirm previous simulation studies showing that Phi-values reflect the position of the perturbed reaction within the chain, with reactions occurring earlier in the sequence producing higher Phi-values than those occurring later in the sequence. The derivation includes an expression for the transmission coefficients of the overall reaction based on the rate constants of an arbitrary, discrete, finite Markov chain. The results indicate that experimental Phi-values can be used to calculate the relative heights of the energy barriers between intermediate states of the chain but provide no information about the energies of the wells along the reaction path. Application of the equations to the case of diliganded acetylcholine receptor channel gating suggests that the transition-state ensemble for this reaction is nearly flat. Although this mechanism accounts for many of the basic features of diliganded and unliganded acetylcholine receptor channel gating, the experimental rate-equilibrium free-energy relationships appear to be more linear than those predicted by the theory.},

Molecular-dynamics simulations show that in the closed state, the channel conductance is ∼12 orders-of-magnitude lower than in the open state. This large drop in conductance is remarkable because even in the functionally closed conformation the pore constriction remains wide enough for the passage of sodium ions, aided by a continuous bridge of ∼12 water molecules. However, we find that the free energy cost of hydrating the hydrophobic gate is large, accounting almost entirely for the energetic barrier blocking ion passage. The free energies of transferring a sodium ion into a prehydrated gate in functionally closed and open states differ by only 1.2 kcal/mol, compared to an 11 kcal/mol difference in the costs of hydrating the hydrophobic gate. Conversely, ion desolvation effects play only minor roles in GLIC ion channel gating. Our simulations help rationalize experiments probing the gating kinetics of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in response to mutations of pore-lining residues. The molecular character and phase behavior of water should thus be included in quantitative descriptions of ion channel gating.},

abstract = {The weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) has become the standard technique for the analysis of umbrella sampling simulations. In this article, we address the challenges (1) of obtaining fast and accurate solutions of the coupled nonlinear WHAM equations, (2) of quantifying the statistical errors of the resulting free energies, (3) of diagnosing possible systematic errors, and (4) of optimally allocating of the computational resources. Traditionally, the WHAM equations are solved by a fixed-point direct iteration method, despite poor convergence and possible numerical inaccuracies in the solutions. Here, we instead solve the mathematically equivalent problem of maximizing a target likelihood function, by using superlinear numerical optimization algorithms with a significantly faster convergence rate. To estimate the statistical errors in one-dimensional free energy profiles obtained from WHAM, we note that for densely spaced umbrella windows with harmonic biasing potentials, the WHAM free energy profile can be approximated by a coarse-grained free energy obtained by integrating the mean restraining forces. The statistical errors of the coarse-grained free energies can be estimated straightforwardly and then used for the WHAM results. A generalization to multidimensional WHAM is described. We also propose two simple statistical criteria to test the consistency between the histograms of adjacent umbrella windows, which help identify inadequate sampling and hysteresis in the degrees of freedom orthogonal to the reaction coordinate. Together, the estimates of the statistical errors and the diagnostics of inconsistencies in the potentials of mean force provide a basis for the efficient allocation of computational resources in free energy simulations.},

abstract = {Natively disordered proteins belong to a unique class of biomolecules whose function is related to their flexibility and their ability to adopt desired conformations upon binding to substrates. In some cases these proteins can bind multiple partners, which can lead to distinct structures and promiscuity in functions. In other words, the capacity to recognize molecular patterns on the substrate is often essential for the folding and function of intrinsically disordered proteins. Biomolecular pattern recognition is extremely relevant both in vivo (e.g., for oligomerization, immune response, induced folding, substrate binding, and molecular switches) and in vitro (e.g., for biosensing, catalysis, chromatography, and implantation). Here, we use a minimalist computational model system to investigate how polar/nonpolar patterns on a surface can induce the folding of an otherwise unstructured peptide. We show that a model peptide that exists in the bulk as a molten globular state consisting of many interconverting structures can fold into either a helix-coil-helix or an extended helix structure in the presence of a complementary designed patterned surface at low hydrophobicity (3.7\%) or a uniform surface at high hydrophobicity (50\%). However, we find that a carefully chosen surface pattern can bind to and catalyze the folding of a natively unfolded protein much more readily or effectively than a surface with a noncomplementary or uniform distribution of hydrophobic residues.},

abstract = {Proteins are highly complex molecules with features exquisitely selected by nature to carry out essential biological functions. Physical chemistry and polymer physics provide us with the tools needed to make sense of this complexity. Upon translation, many proteins fold to a thermodynamically stable form known as the native state. The native state is not static, but consists of a hierarchy of conformations, that are continuously explored through dynamics. In this review we provide a brief introduction to some of the core concepts required in the discussion of the protein native dynamics using energy landscapes ideas. We first discuss recent works which have challenged the structure-function paradigm by demonstrating function in disordered proteins. Next we examine the hierarchical organization in the energy landscapes using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analysis. In particular, the role of direct and water-mediated contacts in sculpting the landscape is elaborated. Another approach to studying the native state ensemble is based on choosing high-resolution order parameters for computing one- or two-dimensional free energy surfaces. We demonstrate that 2D free energy surfaces provide rich thermodynamic and kinetic information about the native state ensemble. Brownian dynamics simulations on such a surface indicate that protein conformational dynamics is weakly activated. Finally, we briefly discuss implicit and coarse-grained protein models and emphasize the solvent role in determining native state structure and dynamics.},

abstract = {Energy landscape theories have provided a common ground for understanding the protein folding problem, which once seemed to be overwhelmingly complicated. At the same time, the native state was found to be an ensemble of interconverting states with frustration playing a more important role compared to the folding problem. The landscape of the folded protein - the native landscape - is glassier than the folding landscape; hence, a general description analogous to the folding theories is difficult to achieve. On the other hand, the native basin phase volume is much smaller, allowing a protein to fully sample its native energy landscape on the biological timescales. Current computational resources may also be used to perform this sampling for smaller proteins, to build a 'topographical map' of the native landscape that can be used for subsequent analysis. Several major approaches to representing this topographical map are highlighted in this review, including the construction of kinetic networks, hierarchical trees and free energy surfaces with subsequent structural and kinetic analyses. In this review, we extensively discuss the important question of choosing proper collective coordinates characterizing functional motions. In many cases, the substates on the native energy landscape, which represent different functional states, can be used to obtain variables that are well suited for building free energy surfaces and analyzing the protein's functional dynamics. Normal mode analysis can provide such variables in cases where functional motions are dictated by the molecule's architecture. Principal component analysis is a more expensive way of inferring the essential variables from the protein's motions, one that requires a long molecular dynamics simulation. Finally, the two popular models for the allosteric switching mechanism, 'preexisting equilibrium' and 'induced fit', are interpreted within the energy landscape paradigm as extreme points of a continuum of transition mechanisms. Some experimental evidence illustrating each of these two models, as well as intermediate mechanisms, is presented and discussed.},

An emphasis is placed on single-molecule fluorescence experiments, which are particularly useful for measuring properties of the denatured state even under conditions of coexistence with the folded state. Attempts to understand the dynamics of collapse, both theoretically and experimentally, are then described. Only an upper limit for the rate of collapse has been obtained so far.

Proton inventory, pH effects, base catalysis and structural studies implicate flavin N(5) deprotonation as rate-determining for recovery. Substitutions of active site residues Ile74, Ile85, Met135 and Met165 alter photoadduct lifetimes by over four orders of magnitude in VVD, and similar changes in other LOV proteins show analogous effects. Adduct state decay rates also correlate with changes in conformational and oligomeric properties of the protein necessary for signaling.

Thus, the interplay among different structural components, taking into account the cooperative interactions, is important in determining the success of protein structure prediction. In this work we present further developments of our knowledge-based force field for alpha/beta proteins, introducing more realistic modeling of many-body interactions governing the folding of beta-sheets. The model's innovations highlight both specific topological characteristics of secondary structures and the generic nonadditive interactions that are mediated by water. We also investigate how a coarse biasing of the protein morphology can be used to understand the role of heterogeneity in protein collapse. Analysis of the simulation results for three test alpha/beta proteins indicates that the addition of the topological and many-body ingredients to the model helps to greatly reduce the roughness in the energy landscape. Consequently, high quality candidate structures for alpha/beta proteins can be generated from simulated annealing runs, using very modest amounts of computer time.},

abstract = {Olfaction in moths is one of the most impressive examples of chemical communication found in nature for its exquisite sensitivity and selectivity. Pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs), present in the antennae of male moth and other insect species, bind the hydrophobic pheromone molecules and transport them to the G protein-coupled olfactory receptor proteins. The targeted delivery of these non-polar ligands to membrane-bound receptors involves ligand release on or near the target cell membranes, the molecular details of which are still not well understood. The PBP from the giant silk moth Antheraea polyphemus (ApolPBP) binds acetate pheromone only at pH above 6.0, and its structure at pH 6.3 has been determined previously. Here we report the solution NMR structure of ApolPBP at the acidic pH 5.2. Comparison of the present structure to that at neutral pH reveals the details of the pH-induced conformational changes and provides mechanistic clues for ligand release at acidic pH. The ApolPBP pH-induced structural change is quite different from that observed for alcohol binding Bombyx mori PBP (BmorPBP), where the C-terminal segment folds into a helix and occupies the ligand binding cavity. We observe a reorientation of helices alpha1, alpha3, and alpha4 at acidic pH caused by protonation of His69, His70 and His95 in the interior. This provides the driving force behind the opening of the ligand binding cavity and the release of the pheromone molecule from its carrier protein near the membrane.},
